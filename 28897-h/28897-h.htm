</blockquote>

  <p>The subject of inheritance is an immense one, and has been treated by
  many authors. One work alone, 'De l'Hérédité Naturelle,' by Dr. Prosper
  Lucas, runs to the length of 1562 pages. We must confine ourselves to
  certain points which have an important bearing on the general subject of
  variation, both with domestic and natural productions. It is obvious that
  a variation which is not inherited throws no light on the derivation of
  species, nor is of any service to man, except in the case of perennial
  plants, which can be propagated by buds.</p>

  <p>If animals and plants had never been domesticated, and wild ones alone
  had been observed, we should probably never have heard the saying, that
  "like begets like." The proposition would have been as self-evident, as
  that all the buds on the same tree are alike, though neither proposition
  is strictly true. For, as has often been remarked, probably no two
  individuals are <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>identically the same. All wild animals
  recognise each other, which shows that there is some difference between
  them; and when the eye is well practised, the shepherd knows each sheep,
  and man can distinguish a fellow-man out of millions on millions of other
  men. Some authors have gone so far as to maintain that the production of
  slight differences is as much a necessary function of the powers of
  generation, as the production of offspring like their parents. This view,
  as we shall see in a future chapter, is not theoretically probable,
  though practically it holds good. The saying that "like begets like" has
  in fact arisen from the perfect confidence felt by breeders, that a
  superior or inferior animal will generally reproduce its kind; but this
  very superiority or inferiority shows that the individual in question has
  departed slightly from its type.</p>

  <p>The whole subject of inheritance is wonderful. When a new character
  arises, whatever its nature may be, it generally tends to be inherited,
  at least in a temporary and sometimes in a most persistent manner. What
  can be more wonderful than that some trifling peculiarity, not
  primordially attached to the species, should be transmitted through the
  male or female sexual cells, which are so minute as not to be visible to
  the naked eye, and afterwards through the incessant changes of a long
  course of development, undergone either in the womb or in the egg, and
  ultimately appear in the offspring when mature, or even when quite old,
  as in the case of certain diseases? Or again, what can be more wonderful
  than the well-ascertained fact that the minute ovule of a good milking
  cow will produce a male, from whom a cell, in union with an ovule, will
  produce a female, and she, when mature, will have large mammary glands,
  yielding an abundant supply of milk, and even milk of a particular
  quality? Nevertheless, the real subject of surprise is, as Sir H. Holland
  has well remarked,<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> not
  that a character should be inherited, but that any should ever fail to be
  inherited. In a future chapter, devoted to an hypothesis which I have
  termed pangenesis, an attempt will be made to show the means by which
  characters of all kinds are transmitted from generation to
  generation.</p>

<p><!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span></p>

  <p>Some writers,<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> who have
  not attended to natural history, have attempted to show that the force of
  inheritance has been much exaggerated. The breeders of animals would
  smile at such simplicity; and if they condescended to make any answer,
  might ask what would be the chance of winning a prize if two inferior
  animals were paired together? They might ask whether the half-wild Arabs
  were led by theoretical notions to keep pedigrees of their horses? Why
  have pedigrees been scrupulously kept and published of the Shorthorn
  cattle, and more recently of the Hereford breed? Is it an illusion that
  these recently improved animals safely transmit their excellent qualities
  even when crossed with other breeds? have the Shorthorns, without good
  reason, been purchased at immense prices and exported to almost every
  quarter of the globe, a thousand guineas having been given for a bull?
  With greyhounds pedigrees have likewise been kept, and the names of such
  dogs, as Snowball, Major, &amp;c., are as well known to coursers as those
  of Eclipse and Herod on the turf. Even with the Gamecock pedigrees of
  famous strains were formerly kept, and extended back for a century. With
  pigs, the Yorkshire and Cumberland breeders "preserve and print
  pedigrees;" and to show how such highly-bred animals are valued, I may
  mention that Mr. Brown, who won all the first prizes for small breeds at
  Birmingham in 1850, sold a young sow and boar of his breed to Lord Ducie
  for 43 guineas; the sow alone was afterwards sold to the Rev. F. Thursby
  for 65 guineas; who writes, "she paid me very well, having sold her
  produce for 300<i>l</i>., and having now four breeding sows from her."<a
  name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Hard cash paid down, over
  and over again, is an excellent test of inherited superiority. In fact,
  the whole art of breeding, from which such great results have been
  attained during the present century, depends on the inheritance of each
  small <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>detail of structure. But inheritance is not
  certain; for if it were, the breeder's art<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> would be reduced to a certainty, and
  there would be little scope left for all that skill and perseverance
  shown by the men who have left an enduring monument of their success in
  the present state of our domesticated animals.</p>

  <p>It is hardly possible, within a moderate compass, to impress on the
  mind of those who have not attended to the subject, the full conviction
  of the force of inheritance which is slowly acquired by rearing animals,
  by studying the many treatises which have been published on the various
  domestic animals, and by conversing with breeders. I will select a few
  facts of the kind, which, as far as I can judge, have most influenced my
  own mind. With man and the domestic animals, certain peculiarities have
  appeared in an individual, at rare intervals, or only once or twice in
  the history of the world, but have reappeared in several of the children
  and grandchildren. Thus Lambert, "the porcupine-man," whose skin was
  thickly covered with warty projections, which were periodically moulted,
  had all his six children and two grandsons similarly affected.<a
  name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The face and body being
  covered with long hair, accompanied by deficient teeth (to which I shall
  hereafter refer), occurred in three successive generations in a Siamese
  family; but this case is not unique, as a woman<a name="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> with a completely hairy face was
  exhibited in London in 1663, and another instance has recently occurred.
  Colonel Hallam<a name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> has
  described a race of two-legged pigs, "the hinder extremities being
  entirely wanting;" and this deficiency was transmitted through three
  generations. In fact, all races presenting any remarkable peculiarity,
  such as solid-hoofed swine, Mauchamp sheep, niata cattle, &amp;c., are
  instances of the long-continued inheritance of rare deviations of
  structure.</p>

  <p>When we reflect that certain extraordinary peculiarities have <!--
  Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>thus
  appeared in a single individual out of many millions, all exposed in the
  same country to the same general conditions of life, and, again, that the
  same extraordinary peculiarity has sometimes appeared in individuals
  living under widely different conditions of life, we are driven to
  conclude that such peculiarities are not directly due to the action of
  the surrounding conditions, but to unknown laws acting on the
  organisation or constitution of the individual;&mdash;that their
  production stands in hardly closer relation to the conditions than does
  life itself. If this be so, and the occurrence of the same unusual
  character in the child and parent cannot be attributed to both having
  been exposed to the same unusual conditions, then the following problem
  is worth consideration, as showing that the result cannot be due, as some
  authors have supposed, to mere coincidence, but must be consequent on the
  members of the same family inheriting something in common in their
  constitution. Let it be assumed that, in a large population, a particular
  affection occurs on an average in one out of a million, so that the <i>à
  priori</i> chance that an individual taken at random will be so affected
  is only one in a million. Let the population consist of sixty millions,
  composed, we will assume, of ten million families, each containing six
  members. On these data, Professor Stokes has calculated for me that the
  odds will be no less than 8333 millions to 1 that in the ten million
  families there will not be even a single family in which one parent and
  two children will be affected by the peculiarity in question. But
  numerous cases could be given, in which several children have been
  affected by the same rare peculiarity with one of their parents; and in
  this case, more especially if the grandchildren be included in the
  calculation, the odds against mere coincidence become something
  prodigious, almost beyond enumeration.</p>

  <p>In some respects the evidence of inheritance is more striking when we
  consider the reappearance of trifling peculiarities. Dr. Hodgkin formerly
  told me of an English family in which, for many generations, some members
  had a single lock differently coloured from the rest of the hair. I knew
  an Irish gentleman, who, on the right side of his head, had a small white
  lock in the midst of his dark hair: he assured me that his grandmother
  had <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span>a
  similar lock on the same side, and his mother on the opposite side. But
  it is superfluous to give instances; every shade of expression, which may
  often be seen alike in parents and children, tells the same story. On
  what a curious combination of corporeal structure, mental character, and
  training, must handwriting depend! yet every one must have noted the
  occasional close similarity of the handwriting in father and son,
  although the father had not taught his son. A great collector of franks
  assured me that in his collection there were several franks of father and
  son hardly distinguishable except by their dates. Hofacker, in Germany,
  remarks on the inheritance of handwriting; and it has even been asserted
  that English boys when taught to write in France naturally cling to their
  English manner of writing.<a name="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
  Gait, gestures, voice, and general bearing are all inherited, as the
  illustrious Hunter and Sir A. Carlisle have insisted.<a name="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> My father communicated to me two or three
  striking instances, in one of which a man died during the early infancy
  of his son, and my father, who did not see this son until grown up and
  out of health, declared that it seemed to him as if his old friend had
  risen from the grave, with all his highly peculiar habits and manners.
  Peculiar manners pass into tricks, and several instances could be given
  of their inheritance; as in the case, often quoted, of the father who
  generally slept on his back, with his right leg crossed over the left,
  and whose daughter, whilst an infant in the cradle, followed exactly the
  same habit, though an attempt was made to cure her.<a name="NtA_10"
  href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> I will give one instance which has
  fallen under my own observation, and which is curious from being a trick
  associated with a peculiar state of mind, namely, pleasurable emotion. A
  boy had the singular habit, when pleased, of rapidly moving his fingers
  parallel to each other, and, when much excited, of raising both hands,
  with the fingers still moving, to the sides of his face on a level with
  the eyes; this boy, when almost an old man, could still hardly resist
  this trick when much pleased, but from its absurdity concealed it. He had
  eight children. Of these, a girl, when <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>pleased, at the age of four
  and a half years, moved her fingers in exactly the same way, and what is
  still odder, when much excited, the raised both her hands, with her
  fingers still moving, to the sides of her face, in exactly the same
  manner as her father had done, and sometimes even still continued to do
  when alone. I never heard of any one excepting this one man and his
  little daughter who had this strange habit; and certainly imitation was
  in this instance out of the question.</p>

  <p>Some writers have doubted whether those complex mental attributes, on
  which genius and talent depend, are inherited, even when both parents are
  thus endowed. But he who will read Mr. Galton's able paper<a
  name="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> on hereditary talent will
  have his doubts allayed.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately it matters not, as far as inheritance is concerned, how
  injurious a quality or structure may be if compatible with life. No one
  can read the many treatises<a name="NtA_12"
  href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> on hereditary disease and doubt this.
  The ancients were strongly of this opinion, or, as Ranchin expresses it,
  <i>Omnes Græci, Arabes, et Latini in eo consentiunt</i>. A long catalogue
  could be given of all sorts of inherited malformations and of
  predisposition to various diseases. With gout, fifty per cent. of the
  cases observed in hospital practice are, according to Dr. Garrod,
  inherited, and a greater percentage in private practice. Every one knows
  how often insanity runs in families, and some of the cases given by Mr.
  Sedgwick are awful,&mdash;as of a surgeon, whose brother, father, and
  four paternal uncles were all insane, the latter dying by suicide; of a
  Jew, whose father, mother, and six brothers and sisters were all mad; and
  in some other cases several members of the same family, during three or
  four successive generations, have committed suicide. Striking instances
  <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>{8}</span>have
  been recorded of epilepsy, consumption, asthma, stone in the bladder,
  cancer, profuse bleeding from the slightest injuries, of the mother not
  giving milk, and of bad parturition being inherited. In this latter
  respect I may mention an odd case given by a good observer,<a
  name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> in which the fault lay in
  the offspring, and not in the mother: in a part of Yorkshire the farmers
  continued to select cattle with large hind-quarters, until they made a
  strain called "Dutch-buttocked," and "the monstrous size of the buttocks
  of the calf was frequently fatal to the cow, and numbers of cows were
  annually lost in calving."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Instead of giving numerous details on various inherited malformations
  and diseases, I will confine myself to one organ, that which is the most
  complex, delicate, and probably best-known in the human frame, namely,
  the eye, with its accessory parts. To begin with the latter: I have heard
  of a family in which parents and children were affected by drooping
  eyelids, in so peculiar a manner, that they could not see without
  throwing their heads backwards; and Sir A. Carlisle<a name="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> specifies a pendulous fold to the
  eyelids as inherited. "In a family," says Sir H. Holland,<a name="NtA_15"
  href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> "where the father had a singular
  elongation of the upper eyelid, seven or eight children were born with
  the same deformity; two or three other children having it not." Many
  persons, as I year from Mr. Paget, have two or three of the hairs in
  their eyebrows (apparently corresponding with the vibrissæ of the lower
  animals) much longer than the others; and even so trifling a peculiarity
  as this certainly runs in families.</p>

  <p>With respect to the eye itself, the highest authority in England, Mr.
  Bowman, has been so kind as to give me the following remarks on certain
  inherited imperfections. First, hypermetropia, or morbidly long sight: in
  this affection, the organ, instead of being spherical, is too flat from
  front to back, and is often altogether too small, so that the retina is
  brought too forward for the focus of the humours; consequently a convex
  glass is required for clear vision of near objects, and frequently even
  of distant ones. This state occurs congenitally, or at a very early age,
  often in several children of the same family, where one of the parents
  has presented it.<a name="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
  Secondly, myopia, or short-sight, in which the eye is egg-shaped, and too
  long from front to back; the retina in this case lies behind the focus,
  and is therefore fitted to see distinctly only very near objects. This
  condition is not commonly congenital, but comes on in youth, the
  liability to it being well known to be transmissible from parent to
  child. The change from the spherical to the ovoidal shape seems the
  immediate <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>{9}</span>consequence of something like inflammation of
  the coats, under which they yield, and there is ground for believing that
  it may often originate in causes acting directly on the individual
  affected, and may thenceforward become transmissible. When both parents
  are myopic Mr. Bowman has observed the hereditary tendency in this
  direction to be heightened, and some of the children to be myopic at an
  earlier age or in a higher degree than their parents. Thirdly, squinting
  is a familiar example of hereditary transmission: it is frequently a
  result of such optical defects as have been above mentioned; but the more
  primary and uncomplicated forms of it are also sometimes in a marked
  degree transmitted in a family. Fourthly, <i>Cataract</i>, or opacity of
  the crystalline lens, is commonly observed in persons whose parents have
  been similarly affected, and often at an earlier age in the children than
  in the parents. Occasionally more than one child in a family is thus
  afflicted, one of whose parents or other relation presents the senile
  form of the complaint. When cataract affects several members of a family
  in the same generation, it is often seen to commence at about the same
  age in each; <i>e.g.</i>, in one family several infants or young persons
  may suffer from it; in another, several persons of middle age. Mr. Bowman
  also informs me that he has occasionally seen, in several members of the
  same family, various defects in either the right or left eye; and Mr.
  White Cooper has often seen peculiarities of vision confined to one eye
  reappearing in the same eye in the offspring.<a name="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The following cases are taken from an able paper by Mr. W. Sedgwick,
  and from Dr. Prosper Lucas.<a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Amaurosis, either congenital or coming
  on late in life, and causing total blindness, is often inherited; it has
  been observed in three successive generations. Congenital absence of the
  iris has likewise been transmitted for three generations, a cleft-iris
  for four generations, being limited in this latter case to the males of
  the family. Opacity of the cornea and congenital smallness of the eyes
  have been inherited. Portal records a curious case, in which a father and
  two sons were rendered blind, whenever the head was bent downwards,
  apparently owing to the crystalline lens, with its capsule, slipping
  through an unusually large pupil into the anterior chamber of the eye.
  Day-blindness, or imperfect vision under a bright light, is inherited, as
  is night-blindness, or an incapacity to see except under a strong light:
  a case has been recorded, by M. Cunier, of this latter defect having
  affected eighty-five members of the same family during six generations.
  The singular incapacity of distinguishing colours, which has been called
  <i>Daltonism</i>, is notoriously hereditary, and has been traced through
  five generations, in which it was confined to the female sex.</p>

  <p>With respect to the colour of the iris: deficiency of colouring matter
  is well known to be hereditary in albinoes. The iris of one eye being of
  a different colour from that of the other, and the iris being spotted,
  are cases which have been inherited. Mr. Sedgwick gives, in addition, on
  the <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>authority of Dr. Osborne,<a name="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> the following curious instance of
  strong inheritance: a family of sixteen sons and five daughters all had
  eyes "resembling in miniature the markings on the back of a tortoiseshell
  cat." The mother of this large family had three sisters and a brother all
  similarly marked, and they derived this peculiarity from their mother,
  who belonged to a family notorious for transmitting it to their
  posterity.</p>

  <p>Finally, Dr. Lucas emphatically remarks that there is not one single
  faculty of the eye which is not subject to anomalies; and not one which
  is not subjected to the principle of inheritance. Mr. Bowman agrees with
  the general truth of this proposition; which of course does not imply
  that all malformations are necessarily inherited; this would not even
  follow if both parents were affected by an anomaly which in most cases
  was transmissible.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Even if no single fact had been known with respect to the inheritance
  of disease and malformations by man, the evidence would have been ample
  in the case of the horse. And this might have been expected, as horses
  breed much quicker than man, are matched with care, and are highly
  valued. I have consulted many works, and the unanimity of the belief by
  veterinaries of all nations in the transmission of various morbid
  tendencies is surprising. Authors, who have had wide experience, give in
  detail many singular cases, and assert that contracted feet, with the
  numerous contingent evils, of ring-bones, curbs, splints, spavin, founder
  and weakness of the front legs, roaring or broken and thick wind,
  melanosis, specific ophthalmia, and blindness (the great French
  veterinary Hazard going so far as to say that a blind race could soon be
  formed), crib-biting, jibbing, and ill-temper, are all plainly
  hereditary. Youatt sums up by saying "there is scarcely a malady to which
  the horse is subject which is not hereditary;" and M. Bernard adds that
  the doctrine "that there is scarcely a disease which does not run in the
  stock, is gaining new advocates every day."<a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> So it <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>is in regard to cattle,
  with consumption, good and bad teeth, fine skin, &amp;c. &amp;c. But
  enough, and more than enough, has been said on disease. Andrew Knight,
  from his own experience, asserts that disease is hereditary with plants;
  and this assertion is endorsed by Lindley.<a name="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Seeing how hereditary evil qualities are, it is fortunate that good
  health, vigour, and longevity are equally inherited. It was formerly a
  well-known practice, when annuities were purchased to be received during
  the lifetime of a nominee, to search out a person belonging to a family
  of which many members had lived to extreme old age. As to the inheritance
  of vigour and endurance, the English race-horse offers an excellent
  instance. Eclipse begot 334, and King Herod 497 winners. A "cock-tail" is
  a horse not purely bred, but with only one-eighth or one-sixteenth impure
  blood in his veins, yet very few instances have ever occurred of such
  horses having won a great race. They are sometimes as fleet for short
  distances as thoroughbreds, but as Mr. Robson, the great trainer,
  asserts, they are deficient in wind, and cannot keep up the pace. Mr.
  Lawrence also remarks, "perhaps no instance has ever occurred of a
  three-part-bred horse saving his '<i>distance</i>' in running two miles
  with thoroughbred racers." It has been stated by Cecil, that when unknown
  horses, whose parents were not celebrated, have unexpectedly won great
  races, as in the case of Priam, they can always be proved to be descended
  on both sides, through many generations, from first-rate ancestors. On
  the Continent, Baron Cameronn challenges, in a German veterinary
  periodical, the opponents of the English race-horse, to name one good
  horse on the Continent which has not some English race-blood in his
  veins.<a name="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With respect to the transmission of the many slight, but <!-- Page 12
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>infinitely
  diversified characters, by which the domestic races of animals and plants
  are distinguished, nothing need be said; for the very existence of
  persistent races proclaims the power of inheritance.</p>

  <p>A few special cases, however, deserve some consideration. It might
  have been anticipated, that deviations from the law of symmetry would not
  have been inherited. But Anderson<a name="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> states that a rabbit produced in a
  litter a young animal having only one ear; and from this animal a breed
  was formed which steadily produced one-eared rabbits. He also mentions a
  bitch, with a single leg deficient, and she produced several puppies with
  the same deficiency. From Hofacker's account<a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> it appears that a one-horned stag was
  seen in 1781 in a forest in Germany, in 1788 two, and afterwards, from
  year to year, many were observed with only one horn on the right side of
  the head. A cow lost a horn by suppuration,<a name="NtA_25"
  href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> and she produced three calves which had
  on the same side of the head, instead of a horn, a small bony lump
  attached merely to the skin; but we here approach the doubtful subject of
  inherited mutilations. A man who is left-handed, and a shell in which the
  spire turns in the wrong direction, are departures from the normal though
  a symmetrical condition, and they are well known to be inherited.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>Polydactylism.</i>&mdash;Supernumerary fingers and toes are
  eminently liable, as various authors have insisted, to transmission, but
  they are noticed here chiefly on account of their occasional regrowth
  after amputation. Polydactylism graduates<a name="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> by multifarious steps from a mere
  cutaneous appendage, not including any bone, to a double hand. But an
  additional digit, supported on a metacarpal bone, and furnished with all
  the proper muscles, nerves, and vessels, is sometimes so perfect, that it
  escapes detection, unless the fingers are actually counted. Occasionally
  there are several supernumerary digits; but usually only one, making the
  total number six. This one may represent either a thumb or finger, being
  attached to the inner or outer margin of the hand. Generally, through the
  law of correlation, both hands and feet are similarly affected. I have
  tabulated the cases recorded in various works or privately communicated
  <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span>to
  me, of forty-six persons with extra digits on one or both hands and feet;
  if in each case all four extremities had been similarly affected, the
  table would have shown a total of ninety-two hands and ninety-two feet
  each with six digits. As it is, seventy-three hands and seventy-five feet
  were thus affected. This proves, in contradiction to the result arrived
  at by Dr. Struthers,<a name="NtA_27" href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
  that the hands are not more frequently affected than the feet.</p>

  <p>The presence of more than five digits is a great anomaly, for this
  number is not normally exceeded by any mammal, bird, or existing
  reptile.<a name="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> Nevertheless,
  supernumerary digits are strongly inherited; they have been transmitted
  through five generations; and in some cases, after disappearing for one,
  two, or even three generations, have reappeared through reversion. These
  facts are rendered, as Professor Huxley has observed, more remarkable
  from its being known in most cases that the affected person had not
  married one similarly affected. In such cases the child of the fifth
  generation would have only 1-32nd part of the blood of his first
  sedigitated ancestor. Other cases are rendered remarkable by the
  affection gathering force, as Dr. Struthers has shown, in each
  generation, though in each the affected person had married one not
  affected; moreover such additional digits are often amputated soon after
  birth, and can seldom have been strengthened by use. Dr. Struthers gives
  the following instance: in the first generation an additional digit
  appeared on one hand; in the second, on both hands; in the third, three
  brothers had both hands, and one of the brothers a foot affected; and in
  the fourth generation all four limbs were affected. Yet we must not
  over-estimate the force of inheritance. Dr. Struthers asserts that cases
  of non-inheritance and of the first appearance of additional digits in
  unaffected families are much more frequent than cases of inheritance.
  Many other deviations of structure, of a nature almost as anomalous as
  supernumerary digits, such as deficient phalanges, thickened joints,
  crooked fingers, &amp;c., are in like manner strongly inherited, and are
  equally subject to intermission with reversion, though in such cases
  there is no reason to suppose that both parents had been similarly
  affected.<a name="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span></p>

  <p>Additional digits have been observed in negroes as well as in other
  races of man, and in several of the lower animals. Six toes have been
  described on the hind feet of the newt (<i>Salamandra cristata</i>), and,
  as it is said, of the frog. It deserves notice from what follows, that
  the six-toed newt, though adult, had preserved some of its larval
  characters; for part of the hyoidal apparatus, which is properly absorbed
  during the act of metamorphosis, was retained. In the dog, six toes on
  the hinder feet have been transmitted through three generations; and I
  have heard of a race of six-toed cats. In several breeds of the fowl the
  hinder toe is double, and is generally transmitted truly, as is well
  shown when Dorkings are crossed with common four-toed breeds.<a
  name="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> With animals which have
  properly less than five digits, the number is sometimes increased to
  five, especially in the front legs, though rarely carried beyond that
  number; but this is due to the development of a digit already existing in
  a more or less rudimentary state. Thus the dog has properly four toes
  behind, but in the larger breeds a fifth toe is commonly, though not
  perfectly, developed. Horses, which properly have one toe alone fully
  developed with rudiments of the others, have been described with each
  foot bearing two or three small separate hoofs: analogous facts have been
  noticed with sheep, goats, and pigs.<a name="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The most interesting point with respect to supernumerary digits is
  their occasional regrowth after amputation. Mr. White<a name="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> describes a child, three years old,
  with a thumb double from the first joint. He removed the lesser thumb,
  which was furnished with a nail; but to his astonishment it grew again,
  and reproduced a nail. The child was then taken to an eminent London
  surgeon, and the newly-grown thumb was wholly removed by its
  socket-joint, but again it grew and reproduced a nail. Dr. Struthers
  mentions a case of partial regrowth of an additional thumb, amputated
  when the child was three months old; and the late Dr. Falconer
  communicated to me an analogous case which had fallen under his own
  observation. A gentleman, who first called my attention to this subject,
  has given me the following facts which occurred in his own family. He
  himself, two brothers, and a sister were born with an extra digit to each
  extremity. His parents were not affected, and there was no tradition in
  the family, or in the village in which the family had long resided, of
  any member having been thus affected. Whilst a child, both additional
  toes, which were attached by bones, were rudely cut off; but the stump of
  one grew again, and a second operation was performed in his thirty-third
  year.</p>

<p><!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span></p>

  <p>He has had fourteen children, of whom three have inherited additional
  digits; and one of them, when about six weeks old, was operated on by an
  eminent surgeon. The additional finger, which was attached by bone to the
  outer side of the hand, was removed at the joint; the wound healed, but
  immediately the digit began growing; and in about three months' time the
  stump was removed for the second time by the root. But it has since grown
  again, and is now fully a third of an inch in length, including a bone;
  so that it will for the third time have to be operated on.</p>

  <p>Now the normal digits in adult man and other mammals, in birds, and,
  as I believe, in true reptiles, have no power of regrowth. The nearest
  approach to this power is exhibited by the occasional reappearance in man
  of imperfect nails on the stumps of his fingers after amputation.<a
  name="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> But man in his embryonic
  condition has a considerable power of reproduction, for Sir J. Simpson<a
  name="NtA_34" href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> has several times
  observed arms which had been cut off in the womb by bands of false
  membrane, and which had grown again to a certain extent. In one instance,
  the extremity was "divided into three minute nodules, on two of which
  small points of nails could be detected;" so that these nodules clearly
  represented fingers in process of regrowth. When, however, we descend to
  the lower vertebrate classes, which are generally looked at as
  representing the higher classes in their embryonic condition, we find
  ample powers of regrowth. Spallanzani<a name="NtA_35"
  href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> cut off the legs and tail of a
  salamander six times, and Bonnet eight times, successively, and they were
  reproduced. An additional digit beyond the proper number was occasionally
  formed after Bonnet had cut off or had divided longitudinally the hand or
  foot, and in one instance three additional digits were thus formed.<a
  name="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> These latter cases appear
  at first sight quite distinct from the congenital production of
  additional digits in the higher animals; but theoretically, as we shall
  see in a future chapter, they probably present no real difference. The
  larvæ or tadpoles of the tailless Batrachians, but not the adults,<a
  name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> are capable of
  reproducing lost members.<a name="NtA_38"
  href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> Lastly, as I have been informed by Mr.
  J.&nbsp;J. Briggs and Mr. F. Buckland, when portions of the pectoral and tail
  fins of various <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>fresh-water fish are cut off, they are
  perfectly reproduced in about six weeks' time.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From these several facts we may infer that supernumerary digits in man
  retain to a certain extent an embryonic condition, and that they resemble
  in this respect the normal digits and limbs in the lower vertebrate
  classes. They also resemble the digits of some of the lower animals in
  the number exceeding five; for no mammal, bird, existing reptile, or
  amphibian (unless the tubercle on the hind feet of the toad and other
  tailless Batrachians be viewed as a digit) has more than five; whilst
  fishes sometimes have in their pectoral fins as many as twenty metacarpal
  and phalangeal bones, which, together with the bony filaments, apparently
  represent our digits with their nails. So, again, in certain extinct
  reptiles, namely, the Ichthyopterygia, "the digits may be seven, eight,
  or nine in number, a significant mark," says Professor Owen, "of piscine
  affinity."<a name="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We encounter much difficulty in attempting to reduce these various
  facts to any rule or law. The inconstant number of the additional
  digits&mdash;their irregular attachment to either the inner or outer
  margin of the hand&mdash;the gradation which can be traced from a mere
  loose rudiment of a single digit to a completely double hand&mdash;the
  occasional appearance of additional digits in the salamander after a limb
  has been amputated&mdash;these various facts appear to indicate mere
  fluctuating monstrosity; and this perhaps is all that can be safely said.
  Nevertheless, as supernumerary digits in the higher animals, from their
  power of regrowth and from the number thus acquired exceeding five,
  partake of the nature of the digits in the lower vertebrate
  animals;&mdash;as they occur by no means rarely, and are transmitted with
  remarkable strength, though perhaps not more strongly than some other
  anomalies;&mdash;and as with animals which have fewer than five digits,
  when an additional one appears it is generally due to the development of
  a visible rudiment;&mdash;we are led in all cases to suspect, that,
  although no actual rudiment can be detected, yet that a latent tendency
  to the formation of an additional digit exists in all mammals, including
  man. On this view, as we shall more plainly see in the <!-- Page 17
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>{17}</span>next chapter
  when discussing latent tendencies, we should have to look at the whole
  case as one of reversion to an enormously remote, lowly-organised, and
  multidigitate progenitor.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I may here allude to a class of facts closely allied to, but somewhat
  different from, ordinary cases of inheritance. Sir H. Holland<a
  name="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> states that brothers and
  sisters of the same family are frequently affected, often at about the
  same age, by the same peculiar disease, not known to have previously
  occurred in the family. He specifies the occurrence of diabetes in three
  brothers under ten years old; he also remarks that children of the same
  family often exhibit in common infantile diseases the same peculiar
  symptoms. My father mentioned to me the case of four brothers who died
  between the ages of sixty and seventy, in the same highly peculiar
  comatose state. An instance has been already given of supernumerary
  digits appearing in four children out of six in a previously unaffected
  family. Dr. Devay states<a name="NtA_41"
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> that two brothers married two sisters,
  their first-cousins, none of the four nor any relation being an albino;
  but the seven children produced from this double marriage were all
  perfect albinoes. Some of these cases, as Mr. Sedgwick<a name="NtA_42"
  href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> has shown, are probably the result of
  reversion to a remote ancestor, of whom no record had been preserved; and
  all these cases are so far directly connected with inheritance that no
  doubt the children inherited a similar constitution from their parents,
  and, from being exposed to nearly similar conditions of life, it is not
  surprising that they should be affected in the same manner and at the
  same period of life.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Most of the facts hitherto given have served to illustrate the force
  of inheritance, but we must now consider cases, grouped as well as the
  subject allows into classes, showing how feeble, capricious, or deficient
  the power of inheritance sometimes is. When a new peculiarity first
  appears, we can never predict whether it will be inherited. If both
  parents from their birth present <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>the same peculiarity, the probability is
  strong that it will be transmitted to at least some of their offspring.
  We have seen that variegation is transmitted much more feebly by seed
  from a branch which had become variegated through bud-variation, than
  from plants which were variegated as seedlings. With most plants the
  power of transmission notoriously depends on some innate capacity in the
  individual: thus Vilmorin<a name="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> raised from a peculiarly coloured
  balsam some seedlings, which all resembled their parent; but of these
  seedlings some failed to transmit the new character, whilst others
  transmitted it to all their descendants during several successive
  generations. So again with a variety of the rose, two plants alone out of
  six were found by Vilmorin to be capable of transmitting the desired
  character.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The weeping or pendulous growth of trees is strongly inherited in some
  cases, and, without any assignable reason, feebly in other cases. I have
  selected this character as an instance of capricious inheritance, because
  it is certainly not proper to the parent-species, and because, both sexes
  being borne on the same tree, both tend to transmit the same character.
  Even supposing that there may have been in some instances crossing with
  adjoining trees of the same species, it is not probable that all the
  seedlings would have been thus affected. At Moccas Court there is a
  famous weeping oak; many of its branches "are 30 feet long, and no
  thicker in any part of this length than a common rope:" this tree
  transmits its weeping character, in a greater or less degree, to all its
  seedlings; some of the young oaks being so flexible that they have to be
  supported by props; others not showing the weeping tendency till about
  twenty years old.<a name="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> Mr.
  Rivers fertilized, as he informs me, the flowers of a new Belgian weeping
  thorn (<i>Cratægus <span class="correction" title="Original reads `oxycantha', corrected by errata, page viii."
  >oxyacantha</span></i>) with pollen from a crimson not-weeping variety,
  and three young trees, "now six or seven years old, show a decided
  tendency to be pendulous, but as yet are not so much so as the
  mother-plant." According to Mr. MacNab,<a name="NtA_45"
  href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> seedlings from a magnificent weeping
  birch (<i>Betula alba</i>), in the Botanic Garden at Edinburgh, grew for
  the first ten or fifteen years upright, but then all became weepers like
  their parent. A peach with pendulous branches, like those of the weeping
  willow, has been found capable of propagation by seed.<a name="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> Lastly, a weeping and almost prostrate
  yew (<i>Taxus baccata</i>) was found in a hedge in Shropshire; it was a
  male, but one branch bore female flowers, and produced berries; these,
  <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>{19}</span>being sown, produced seventeen trees, all of
  which had exactly the same peculiar habit with the parent-tree.<a
  name="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

  <p>These facts, it might have been thought, would have been sufficient to
  render it probable that a pendulous habit would in all cases be strictly
  inherited. But let us look to the other side. Mr. MacNab<a name="NtA_48"
  href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> sowed seeds of the weeping beech
  (<i>Fagus sylvanica</i>), but succeeded in raising only common beeches.
  Mr. Rivers, at my request, raised a number of seedlings from three
  distinct varieties of weeping elm; and at least one of the parent-trees
  was so situated that it could not have been crossed by any other elm; but
  none of the young trees, now about a foot or two in height, show the
  least signs of weeping. Mr. Rivers formerly sowed above twenty thousand
  seeds of the weeping ash (<i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>), and not a single
  seedling was in the least degree pendulous: in Germany, M. Borchmeyer
  raised a thousand seedlings, with the same result. Nevertheless, Mr.
  Anderson, of the Chelsea Botanic Garden, by sowing seed from a weeping
  ash, which was found before the year 1780, in Cambridgeshire, raised
  several pendulous trees.<a name="NtA_49"
  href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> Professor Henslow also informs me that
  some seedlings from a female weeping ash in the Botanic Garden at
  Cambridge were at first a little pendulous, but afterwards became quite
  upright: it is probable that this latter tree, which transmits to a
  certain extent its pendulous habit, was derived by a bud from the same
  original Cambridgeshire stock; whilst other weeping ashes may have had a
  distinct origin. But the crowning case, communicated to me by Mr. Rivers,
  which shows how capricious is the inheritance of a pendulous habit, is
  that a variety of another species of ash (<i>F. lentiscifolia</i>) which
  was formerly pendulous, "now about twenty years old has long lost this
  habit, every shoot being remarkably erect; but seedlings formerly raised
  from it were perfectly prostrate, the stems not rising more than two
  inches above the ground." Thus the weeping variety of the common ash,
  which has been extensively propagated by buds during a long period, did
  not, with Mr. Rivers, transmit its character to one seedling out of above
  twenty thousand; whereas the weeping variety of a second species of ash,
  which could not, whilst grown in the same garden, retain its own weeping
  character, transmitted to its seedlings the pendulous habit in
  excess!</p>

  <p>Many analogous facts could be given, showing how apparently capricious
  is the principle of inheritance. All the seedlings from a variety of the
  Barberry (<i>B. vulgaris</i>) with red leaves inherited the same
  character; only about one-third of the seedlings of the copper Beech
  (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>) had purple leaves. Not one out of a hundred
  seedlings of a variety of the <i>Cerasus padus</i>, with yellow fruit,
  bore yellow fruit: one-twelfth of the seedlings of the variety of
  <i>Cornus mascula</i>, with yellow fruit, came true:<a name="NtA_50"
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> and lastly, all the trees raised by my
  father from a yellow-berried holly (<i>Ilex aquifolium</i>), <!-- Page 20
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>found wild,
  produced yellow berries. Vilmorin<a name="NtA_51"
  href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> observed in a bed of <i>Saponaria
  calabrica</i> an extremely dwarf variety, and raised from it a large
  number of seedlings; some of these partially resembled their parent, and
  he selected their seed; but the grandchildren were not in the least
  dwarfed: on the other hand, he observed a stunted and bushy variety of
  <i>Tagetes signata</i> growing in the midst of the common varieties by
  which it was probably crossed; for most of the seedlings raised from this
  plant were intermediate in character, only two perfectly resembling their
  parent; but seed saved from these two plants reproduced the new variety
  so truly, that hardly any selection has since been necessary.</p>

  <p>Flowers transmit their colour truly, or most capriciously. Many
  annuals come true: thus I purchased German seeds of thirty-four named
  sub-varieties of one <i>race</i> of ten-week stocks (<i>Matthiola
  annua</i>), and raised a hundred and forty plants, all of which, with the
  exception of a single plant, came true. In saying this, however, it must
  be understood that I could distinguish only twenty kinds out of the
  thirty-four named sub-varieties; nor did the colour of the flower always
  correspond with the name affixed to the packet; but I say that they came
  true, because in each of the thirty-six short rows every plant was
  absolutely alike, with the one single exception. Again, I procured
  packets of German seed of twenty-five named varieties of common and
  quilled asters, and raised a hundred and twenty-four plants; of these,
  all except ten were true in the above limited sense; and I considered
  even a wrong shade of colour as false.</p>

  <p>It is a singular circumstance that white varieties generally transmit
  their colour much more truly than any other variety. This fact probably
  stands in close relation with one observed by Verlot,<a name="NtA_52"
  href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> namely, that flowers which are normally
  white rarely vary into any other colour. I have found that the white
  varieties of <i>Delphinium consolida</i> and of the Stock are the truest.
  It is, indeed, sufficient to look through a nurseryman's seed-list, to
  see the large number of white varieties which can be propagated by seed.
  The several coloured varieties of the sweet-pea (<i>Lathyrus
  odoratus</i>) are very true; but I hear from Mr. Masters, of Canterbury,
  who has particularly attended to this plant, that the white variety is
  the truest. The hyacinth, when propagated by seed, is extremely
  inconstant in colour, but "white hyacinths almost always give by seed
  white-flowered plants;"<a name="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
  and Mr. Masters informs me that the yellow varieties also reproduce their
  colour, but of different shades. On the other hand, pink and blue
  varieties, the latter being the natural colour, are not nearly so true:
  hence, as Mr. Masters has remarked to me, "we see that a garden variety
  may acquire a more permanent habit than a natural species;" but it should
  have been added, that this occurs under cultivation, and therefore under
  changed conditions.</p>

  <p>With many flowers, especially perennials, nothing can be more
  fluctuating than the colour of the seedlings, as is notoriously the case
  with verbenas, carnations, dahlias, cinerarias, and others.<a
  name="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> I sowed seed of twelve
  <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span>named varieties of Snapdragon
  (<i>Antirrhinum majus</i>), and utter confusion was the result. In most
  cases the extremely fluctuating colour of seedling plants is probably in
  chief part due to crosses between differently-coloured varieties during
  previous generations. It is almost certain that this is the case with the
  polyanthus and coloured primrose (<i>Primula veris</i> and
  <i>vulgaris</i>), from their reciprocally dimorphic structure;<a
  name="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> and these are plants
  which florists speak of as never come true by seed: but if care be taken
  to prevent crossing, neither species is by any means very inconstant in
  colour; thus I raised twenty-three plants from a purple primrose,
  fertilised by Mr. J. Scott with its own pollen, and eighteen came up
  purple of different shades, and only five reverted to the ordinary yellow
  colour: again, I raised twenty plants from a bright-red cowslip,
  similarly treated by Mr. Scott, and every one perfectly resembled its
  parent in colour, as likewise did, with the exception of a single plant,
  73 grandchildren. Even with the most variable flowers, it is probable
  that each delicate shade of colour might be permanently fixed so as to be
  transmitted by seed, by cultivation in the same soil, by long-continued
  selection, and especially by the prevention of crosses. I infer this from
  certain annual larkspurs (<i>Delphinium consolida</i> and <i>ajacis</i>),
  of which common seedlings present a greater diversity of colour than any
  other plant known to me; yet on procuring seed of five named German
  varieties of <i>D. consolida</i>, only nine plants out of ninety-four
  were false; and the seedlings of six varieties of <i>D. ajacis</i> were
  true in the same manner and degree as with the stocks above described. A
  distinguished botanist maintains that the annual species of Delphinium
  are always self-fertilised; therefore I may mention that thirty-two
  flowers on a branch of <i>D. consolida</i>, enclosed in a net, yielded
  twenty-seven capsules, with an average of 17.2 seed in each; whilst five
  flowers, under the same net, which were artificially fertilised, in the
  same manner as must be effected by bees during their incessant visits,
  yielded five capsules with an average of 35.2 fine seed; and this shows
  that the agency of insects is necessary for the full fertility of this
  plant. Analogous facts could be given with respect to the crossing of
  many other flowers, such as carnations, &amp;c., of which the varieties
  fluctuate much in colour.</p>

  <p>As with flowers, so with our domesticated animals, no character is
  more variable than colour, and probably in no animal more so than with
  the horse. Yet with a little care in breeding, it appears that races of
  any colour might soon be formed. Hofacker gives the result of matching
  two hundred and sixteen mares of four different colours with
  like-coloured stallions, without regard to the colour of their ancestors;
  and of the two hundred and sixteen colts born, eleven alone failed to
  inherit the colour of their parents: Autenrieth and Ammon assert that,
  after two generations, colts of a uniform colour are produced with
  certainty.<a name="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In a few rare cases peculiarities fail to be inherited, apparently
  from the force of inheritance being too strong. I have been assured by
  breeders of the canary-bird that to get a good <!-- Page 22 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span>jonquil-coloured bird it
  does not answer to pair two jonquils, as the colour then comes out too
  strong, or is even brown. So again, if two crested canaries are paired,
  the young birds rarely inherit this character:<a name="NtA_57"
  href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> for in crested birds a narrow space of
  bare skin is left on the back of the head, where the feathers are
  up-turned to form the crest, and, when both parents are thus
  characterised, the bareness becomes excessive, and the crest itself fails
  to be developed. Mr. Hewitt, speaking of Laced Sebright Bantams, says<a
  name="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> that, "why this should be
  so, I know not, but I am confident that those that are best laced
  frequently produce offspring very far from perfect in their markings,
  whilst those exhibited by myself, which have so often proved successful,
  were bred from the union of heavily-laced birds with those that were
  scarcely sufficiently laced."</p>

  <p>It is a singular fact that, although several deaf-mutes often occur in
  the same family, and though their cousins and other relations are often
  in the same condition, yet their parents are very rarely deaf-mutes. To
  give a single instance: not one scholar out of 148, who were at the same
  time in the London Institution, was the child of parents similarly
  afflicted. So again, when a male or a female deaf-mute marries a sound
  person, their children are most rarely affected: in Ireland out of 203
  children thus produced one alone was mute. Even when both parents have
  been deaf-mutes, as in the case of forty-one marriages in the United
  States and of six in Ireland, only two deaf and dumb children were
  produced. Mr. Sedgwick,<a name="NtA_59" href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>
  in commenting on this remarkable and fortunate failure in the power of
  transmission in the direct line, remarks that it may possibly be owing to
  "excess having reversed the action of some natural law in development."
  But it is safer in the present state of our knowledge to look at the
  whole case as simply unintelligible.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>With respect to the inheritance of structures mutilated by injuries or
  altered by disease it is difficult to come to any <!-- Page 23 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span>definite conclusion. In
  some cases mutilations have been practised for a vast number of
  generations without any inherited result. Godron has remarked<a
  name="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> that different races of
  man have from time immemorial knocked out their upper incisors, cut off
  joints of their fingers, made holes of immense size through the lobes of
  their ears or through their nostrils, made deep gashes in various parts
  of their bodies, and there is no reason whatever to suppose that these
  mutilations have ever been inherited. Adhesions due to inflammation and
  pits from the small-pox (and formerly many consecutive generations must
  have been thus pitted) are not inherited. With respect to Jews, I have
  been assured by three medical men of the Jewish faith that circumcision,
  which has been practised for so many ages, has produced no inherited
  effect; Blumenbach, on the other hand, asserts<a name="NtA_61"
  href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> that in Germany Jews are often born in
  a condition rendering circumcision difficult, so that a name is here
  applied to them signifying "born circumcised." The oak and other trees
  must have borne galls from primeval times, yet they do not produce
  inherited excrescences; many other such facts could be adduced.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, various cases have been recorded of cats, dogs, and
  horses, which have had their tails, legs, &amp;c., amputated or injured,
  producing offspring with the same parts ill-formed; but as it is not at
  all rare for similar malformations to appear spontaneously, all such
  cases may be due to mere coincidence. Nevertheless, Dr. Prosper Lucas has
  given, on good authorities, such a long list of inherited injuries, that
  it is difficult not to believe in them. Thus, a cow that had lost a horn
  from an accident with consequent suppuration, produced three calves which
  were hornless on the same side of the head. With the horse, there seems
  hardly a doubt that bony exostoses on the legs, caused by too much
  travelling on hard roads, are inherited. Blumenbach records the case of a
  man who had his little finger on the right hand almost cut off, and which
  in consequence grew crooked, and his sons had the same finger on the same
  hand similarly crooked. A soldier, fifteen years before his marriage,
  lost his left eye from purulent ophthalmia, and his <!-- Page 24 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span>two sons were
  microphthalmic on the same side.<a name="NtA_62"
  href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> In all such cases, if truthfully
  reported, in which the parent has had an organ injured on one side, and
  more than one child has been born with the same organ affected on the
  same side, the chances against mere coincidence are enormous. But perhaps
  the most remarkable and trustworthy fact is that given by Dr.
  Brown-Séquard,<a name="NtA_63" href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> namely,
  that many young guinea-pigs inherited an epileptic tendency from parents
  which had been subjected to a particular operation, inducing in the
  course of a few weeks a convulsive disease like epilepsy: and it should
  be especially noted that this eminent physiologist bred a large number of
  guinea-pigs from animals which had not been operated on, and not one of
  these manifested the epileptic tendency. On the whole, we can hardly
  avoid admitting, that injuries and mutilations, especially when followed
  by disease, or perhaps exclusively when thus followed, are occasionally
  inherited.</p>

  <p>Although many congenital monstrosities are inherited, of which
  examples have already been given, and to which may be added the lately
  recorded case of the transmission during a century of hare-lip with a
  cleft-palate in the writer's own family,<a name="NtA_64"
  href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> yet other malformations are rarely or
  never inherited. Of these later cases, many are probably due to injuries
  in the womb or egg, and would come under the head of non-inherited
  injuries or mutilations. With plants, a long catalogue of inherited
  monstrosities of the most serious and diversified nature could easily be
  given; and with plants, there is no reason to suppose that monstrosities
  are caused by direct injuries to the seed or embryo.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Causes of Non-inheritance.</i></p>

  <p>A large number of cases of non-inheritance are intelligible on the
  principle, that a strong tendency to inheritance does exist, but <!--
  Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>that it
  is overborne by hostile or unfavourable conditions of life. No one would
  expect that our improved pigs, if forced during several generations to
  travel about and root in the ground for their own subsistence, would
  transmit, as truly as they now do, their tendency to fatten, and their
  short muzzles and legs. Dray-horses assuredly would not long transmit
  their great size and massive limbs, if compelled to live on a cold, damp
  mountainous region; we have indeed evidence of such deterioration in the
  horses which have run wild on the Falkland Islands. European dogs in
  India often fail to transmit their true character. Our sheep in tropical
  countries lose their wool in a few generations. There seems also to be a
  close relation between certain peculiar pastures and the inheritance of
  an enlarged tail in fat-tailed sheep, which form one of the most ancient
  breeds in the world. With plants, we have seen that the American
  varieties of maize lose their proper character in the course of two or
  three generations, when cultivated in Europe. Our cabbages, which here
  come so true by seed, cannot form heads in hot countries. Under changed
  circumstances, periodical habits of life soon fail to be transmitted, as
  the period of maturity in summer and winter wheat, barley, and vetches.
  So it is with animals; for instance, a person whose statement I can
  trust, procured eggs of Aylesbury ducks from that town, where they are
  kept in houses and are reared as early as possible for the London market;
  the ducks bred from these eggs in a distant part of England, hatched
  their first brood on January 24th, whilst common ducks, kept in the same
  yard and treated in the same manner, did not hatch till the end of March;
  and this shows that the period of hatching was inherited. But the
  grandchildren of these Aylesbury ducks completely lost their early habit
  of incubation, and hatched their eggs at the same time with the common
  ducks of the same place.</p>

  <p>Many cases of non-inheritance apparently result from the conditions of
  life continually inducing fresh variability. We have seen that when the
  seeds of pears, plums, apples, &amp;c., are sown, the seedlings generally
  inherit some degree of family likeness from the parent-variety. Mingled
  with these seedlings, a few, and sometimes many, worthless, wild-looking
  plants commonly appear; and their appearance may be attributed to the
  principle of reversion. But scarcely a single seedling will be found <!--
  Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>perfectly to resemble the parent-form; and
  this, I believe, may be accounted for by constantly recurring variability
  induced by the conditions of life. I believe in this, because it has been
  observed that certain fruit-trees truly propagate their kind whilst
  growing on their own roots, but when grafted on other stocks, and by this
  process their natural state is manifestly affected, they produce
  seedlings which vary greatly, departing from the parental type in many
  characters.<a name="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> Metzger, as
  stated in the ninth chapter, found that certain kinds of wheat brought
  from Spain and cultivated in Germany, failed during many years to
  reproduce themselves truly; but that at last, when accustomed to their
  new conditions, they ceased to be variable,&mdash;that is, they became
  amenable to the power of inheritance. Nearly all the plants which cannot
  be propagated with any approach to certainty by seed, are kinds which
  have long been propagated by buds, cuttings, offsets, tubers, &amp;c.,
  and have in consequence been frequently exposed during their individual
  lives to widely diversified conditions of life. Plants thus propagated
  become so variable, that they are subject, as we have seen in the last
  chapter, even to bud-variation. Our domesticated animals, on the other
  hand, are not exposed during their individual lives to such extremely
  diversified conditions, and are not liable to such extreme variability;
  therefore they do not lose the power of transmitting most of their
  characteristic features. In the foregoing remarks on non-inheritance,
  crossed breeds are of course excluded, as their diversity mainly depends
  on the unequal development of characters derived from either parent,
  modified by the principles of reversion and prepotency.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Conclusion.</i></p>

  <p>It has, I think, been shown in the early part of this chapter how
  strongly new characters of the most diversified nature, whether normal or
  abnormal, injurious or beneficial, whether affecting organs of the
  highest or most trifling importance, are inherited. Contrary to the
  common opinion, it is often sufficient for the inheritance of some
  peculiar character, that one parent alone should possess it, as in most
  cases in which the rarer <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span>anomalies have been transmitted. But the
  power of transmission is extremely variable: in a number of individuals
  descended from the same parents, and treated in the same manner, some
  display this power in a perfect manner, and in some it is quite
  deficient; and for this difference no reason can be assigned. In some
  cases the effects of injuries or mutilations apparently are inherited;
  and we shall see in a future chapter that the effects of the
  long-continued use and disuse of parts are certainly inherited. Even
  those characters which are considered the most fluctuating, such as
  colour, are with rare exceptions transmitted much more forcibly than is
  generally supposed. The wonder, indeed, in all cases is not that any
  character should be transmitted, but that the power of inheritance should
  ever fail. The checks to inheritance, as far as we know them, are,
  firstly, circumstances hostile to the particular character in question;
  secondly, conditions of life incessantly inducing fresh variability; and
  lastly, the crossing of distinct varieties during some previous
  generation, together with reversion or atavism&mdash;that is, the
  tendency in the child to resemble its grand-parents or more remote
  ancestors instead of its immediate parents. This latter subject will be
  fully discussed in the following chapter.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The great principle of inheritance to be discussed in this chapter has
  been recognised by agriculturists and authors of various nations, as
  shown by the scientific term <i>Atavism</i>, derived from atavus, an
  ancestor; by the English terms of <i>Reversion</i>, or <i>Throwing
  back</i>; by the French <i>Pas-en-arrière</i>; and by the German
  <i>Rück-schlag</i>, or <i>Rück-schritt</i>. When the child resembles
  either grandparent more closely than its immediate parents, our attention
  is not much arrested, though in truth the fact is highly remarkable; but
  when the child resembles some remote ancestor, or some distant member in
  a collateral line,&mdash;and we must attribute the latter case to the
  descent of all the members from a common progenitor,&mdash;we feel a just
  degree of astonishment. When one parent alone displays some
  newly-acquired and generally inheritable character, and the offspring do
  not inherit it, the cause may lie in the other parent having the power of
  prepotent transmission. But when both parents are similarly
  characterised, and the child does not, whatever the cause may be, inherit
  the character in question, but resembles its grandparents, we have one of
  the simplest cases of reversion. We continually see another and even more
  simple case of atavism, though not generally included under this head,
  namely, when <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span>the son more closely resembles his maternal
  than his paternal grandsire in some male attribute, as in any peculiarity
  in the beard of man, the horns of the bull, the hackles or comb of the
  cock, or, as in certain diseases necessarily confined to the male sex;
  for the mother cannot possess or exhibit such male attributes, yet the
  child has inherited them, through her blood, from his maternal
  grandsire.</p>

  <p>The cases of reversion may be divided into two main classes, which,
  however, in some instances, blend into each other; namely, first, those
  occurring in a variety or race which has not been crossed, but has lost
  by variation some character that it formerly possessed, and which
  afterwards reappears. The second class includes all cases in which a
  distinguishable individual, sub-variety, race, or species, has at some
  former period been crossed with a distinct form, and a character derived
  from this cross, after having disappeared during one or several
  generations, suddenly reappears. A third class, differing only in the
  manner of reproduction, might be formed to include all cases of reversion
  effected by means of buds, and therefore independent of true or seminal
  generation. Perhaps even a fourth class might be instituted, to include
  reversions by segments in the same individual flower or fruit, and in
  different parts of the body in the same individual animal as it grows
  old. But the two first main classes will be sufficient for our
  purpose.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Reversion to lost Characters by pure or uncrossed
  forms.</i>&mdash;Striking instances of this first class of cases were
  given in the sixth chapter, namely, of the occasional reappearance, in
  variously-coloured pure breeds of the pigeon, of blue birds with all the
  marks which characterise the wild <i>Columba livia</i>. Similar cases
  were given in the case of the fowl. With the common ass, as we now know
  that the legs of the wild progenitor are striped, we may feel assured
  that the occasional appearance of such stripes in the domestic animal is
  a case of simple reversion. But I shall be compelled to refer again to
  these cases, and therefore will here pass them over.</p>

  <p>The aboriginal species from which our domesticated cattle and sheep
  are descended, no doubt possessed horns; but several hornless breeds are
  now well established. Yet in these&mdash;for instance, <!-- Page 30
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>in Southdown
  sheep&mdash;"it is not unusual to find among the male lambs some with
  small horns." The horns, which thus occasionally reappear in other polled
  breeds, either "grow to the full size, or are curiously attached to the
  skin alone and hang loosely down, or drop off."<a name="NtA_66"
  href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> The Galloways and Suffolk cattle have
  been hornless for the last 100 or 150 years, but a horned calf, with the
  horn often loosely attached, is occasionally born.<a name="NtA_67"
  href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is reason to believe that sheep in their early domesticated
  condition were "brown or dingy black;" but even in the time of David
  certain flocks were spoken of as white as snow. During the classical
  period the sheep of Spain are described by several ancient authors as
  being black, red, or tawny.<a name="NtA_68"
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> At the present day, notwithstanding the
  great care which is taken to prevent it, particoloured lambs and some
  entirely black are occasionally dropped by our most highly improved and
  valued breeds, such as the Southdowns. Since the time of the famous
  Bakewell, during the last century, the Leicester sheep have been bred
  with the most scrupulous care; yet occasionally grey-faced, or
  black-spotted, or wholly black lambs appear.<a name="NtA_69"
  href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> This occurs still more frequently with
  the less improved breeds, such as the Norfolks.<a name="NtA_70"
  href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> As bearing on this tendency in sheep to
  revert to dark colours, I may state (though in doing so I trench on the
  reversion of crossed breeds, and likewise on the subject of prepotency)
  that the Rev. W.&nbsp;D. Fox was informed that seven white Southdown ewes were
  put to a so-called Spanish ram, which had two small black spots on his
  sides, and they produced thirteen lambs, all perfectly black. Mr. Fox
  believes that this ram belonged to a breed which he has himself kept, and
  which is always spotted with black and white; and he finds that Leicester
  sheep crossed by rams of this breed always produce black lambs: he has
  gone on recrossing these crossed sheep with pure white Leicesters during
  three successive <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span>generations, but always with the same
  result. Mr. Fox was also told by the friend from whom the spotted breed
  was procured, that he likewise had gone on for six or seven generations
  crossing with white sheep, but still black lambs were invariably
  produced.</p>

  <p>Similar facts could be given with respect to tailless breeds of
  various animals. For instance, Mr. Hewitt<a name="NtA_71"
  href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> states that chickens bred from some
  Rumpless fowls, which were reckoned so good that they won a prize at an
  exhibition, "in a considerable number of instances were furnished with
  fully developed tail-feathers." On inquiry, the original breeder of these
  fowls stated that, from the time when he had first kept them, they had
  often produced fowls furnished with tails; but that these latter would
  again reproduce rumpless chickens.</p>

  <p>Analogous cases of reversion occur in the vegetable kingdom; thus
  "from seeds gathered from the finest cultivated varieties of Heartsease
  (<i>Viola tricolor</i>), plants perfectly wild both in their foliage and
  their flowers are frequently produced;"<a name="NtA_72"
  href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> but the reversion in this instance is
  not to a very ancient period, for the best existing varieties of the
  heartsease are of comparatively modern origin. With most of our
  cultivated vegetables there is some tendency to reversion to what is
  known to be, or may be presumed to be, their aboriginal state; and this
  would be more evident if gardeners did not generally look over their beds
  of seedlings, and pull up the false plants or "rogues" as they are
  called. It has already been remarked, that some few seedling apples and
  pears generally resemble, but apparently are not identical with, the wild
  trees from which they are descended. In our turnip<a name="NtA_73"
  href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> and carrot-beds a few plants often
  "break"&mdash;that is, flower too soon; and their roots are generally
  found to be hard and stringy, as in the parent-species. By the aid of a
  little selection, carried on during a few generations, most of our
  cultivated plants could probably be brought back, without any great
  change in their conditions of life, to a wild or nearly wild condition:
  Mr. Buckman has effected this with the parsnip;<a name="NtA_74"
  href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> <!-- Page 32 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span>and Mr. Hewett C. Watson,
  as he informs me, selected, during three generations, "the most diverging
  plants of Scotch kail, perhaps one of the least modified varieties of the
  cabbage; and in the third generation some of the plants came very close
  to the forms now established in England about old castle-walls, and
  called indigenous."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Reversion in Animals and Plants which have run wild.</i>&mdash;In
  the cases hitherto considered, the reverting animals and plants have not
  been exposed to any great or abrupt change in their conditions of life
  which could have induced this tendency; but it is very different with
  animals and plants which have become feral or run wild. It has been
  repeatedly asserted in the most positive manner by various authors, that
  feral animals and plants invariably return to their primitive specific
  type. It is curious on what little evidence this belief rests. Many of
  our domesticated animals could not subsist in a wild state; thus, the
  more highly improved breeds of the pigeon will not "field" or search for
  their own food. Sheep have never become feral, and would be destroyed by
  almost every beast of prey. In several cases we do not know the
  aboriginal parent-species, and cannot possibly tell whether or not there
  has been any close degree of reversion. It is not known in any instance
  what variety was first turned out; several varieties have probably in
  some cases run wild, and their crossing alone would tend to obliterate
  their proper character. Our domesticated animals and plants, when they
  run wild, must always be exposed to new conditions of life, for, as Mr.
  Wallace<a name="NtA_75" href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> has well
  remarked, they have to obtain their own food, and are exposed to
  competition with the native productions. Under these circumstances, if
  our domesticated animals did not undergo change of some kind, the result
  would be quite opposed to the conclusions arrived at in this work.
  Nevertheless, I do not doubt that the simple fact of animals and plants
  becoming feral, does cause some tendency to reversion to the primitive
  state; though this tendency has been much exaggerated by some
  authors.</p>

<p><!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>I will briefly run through the recorded cases. With neither horses nor
  cattle is the primitive stock known; and it has been shown in former
  chapters that they have assumed different colours in different countries.
  Thus the horses which have run wild in South America are generally
  brownish-bay, and in the East dun-coloured; their heads have become
  larger and coarser, and this may be due to reversion. No careful
  description has been given of the feral goat. Dogs which have run wild in
  various countries have hardly anywhere assumed a uniform character; but
  they are probably descended from several domestic races, and aboriginally
  from several distinct species. Feral cats, both in Europe and La Plata,
  are regularly striped; in some cases they have grown to an unusually
  large size, but do not differ from the domestic animal in any other
  character. When variously-coloured tame rabbits are turned out in Europe,
  they generally reacquire the colouring of the wild animal; there can be
  no doubt that this does really occur, but we should remember that
  oddly-coloured and conspicuous animals would suffer much from beasts of
  prey and from being easily shot; this at least was the opinion of a
  gentleman who tried to stock his woods with a nearly white variety; and
  when thus destroyed, they would in truth be supplanted by, instead of
  being transformed into, the common rabbit. We have seen that the feral
  rabbits of Jamaica, and especially of Porto Santo, have assumed new
  colours and other new characters. The best known case of reversion, and
  that on which the widely-spread belief in its universality apparently
  rests, is that of pigs. These animals have run wild in the West Indies,
  South America, and the Falkland Islands, and have everywhere acquired the
  dark colour, the thick bristles, and great tusks of the wild boar; and
  the young have reacquired longitudinal stripes. But even in the case of
  the pig, Roulin describes the half-wild animals in different parts of
  South America as differing in several respects. In Louisiana the pig<a
  name="NtA_76" href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> has run wild, and is said
  to differ a little in form, and much in colour, from the domestic animal,
  yet does not closely resemble the wild boar of Europe. With pigeons and
  fowls,<a name="NtA_77" href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> it is not known
  what variety was first turned out, nor what character the feral birds
  have assumed. The guinea-fowl in the West Indies, when feral, seems to
  vary more than in the domesticated state.</p>

  <p>With respect to plants run wild, Dr. Hooker<a name="NtA_78"
  href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> has strongly insisted on what slight
  evidence the common belief in their power of reversion rests. Godron<a
  name="NtA_79" href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> describes wild turnips,
  carrots, and celery; but these plants in their cultivated state hardly
  differ from their wild prototypes, except in the <!-- Page 34 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>succulency and
  enlargement of certain parts,&mdash;characters which would be surely lost
  by plants growing in a poor soil and struggling with other plants. No
  cultivated plant has run wild on so enormous a scale as the cardoon
  (<i>Cynara cardunculus</i>) in La Plata. Every botanist who has seen it
  growing there, in vast beds, as high as a horse's back, has been struck
  with its peculiar appearance; but whether it differs in any important
  point from the cultivated Spanish form, which is said not to be prickly
  like its American descendant, or whether it differs from he wild
  Mediterranean species, which is said not to be social, I do not know.</p>

  <p><i>Reversion to Characters derived from a Cross, in the case of
  Sub-varieties, Races, and Species.</i>&mdash;When an individual having
  some recognizable peculiarity unites with another of the same
  sub-variety, not having the peculiarity in question, it often reappears
  in the descendants after an interval of several generations. Every one
  must have noticed, or heard from old people of children closely
  resembling in appearance or mental disposition, or in so small and
  complex a character as expression, one of their grandparents, or some
  more distant collateral relation. Very many anomalies of structure and
  diseases,<a name="NtA_80" href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> of which
  instances have been given in the last chapter, have come into a family
  from one parent, and have reappeared in the progeny after passing over
  two or three generations. The following case has been communicated to me
  on good authority, and may, I believe, be fully trusted: a pointer-bitch
  produced seven puppies; four were marked with blue and white, which is so
  unusual a colour with pointers that she was thought to have played false
  with one of the greyhounds, and the whole litter was condemned; but the
  gamekeeper was permitted to save one as a curiosity. Two years afterwards
  a friend of the owner saw the young dog, and declared that he was the
  image of his old pointer-bitch Sappho, the only blue and white pointer of
  pure descent which he had ever seen. This led to close inquiry, and it
  was proved that he was the great-great-grandson of Sappho; so that,
  according to the common expression, he had only 1-16th of her blood in
  his veins. Here it can hardly be doubted that a character derived from a
  cross with an individual of the same variety reappeared after passing
  over three generations.</p>

<p><!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span></p>

  <p>When two distinct races are crossed, it is notorious that the tendency
  in the offspring to revert to one or both parent-forms is strong, and
  endures for many generations. I have myself seen the clearest evidence of
  this in crossed pigeons and with various plants. Mr. Sidney<a
  name="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> states that, in a litter
  of Essex pigs, two young ones appeared which were the image of the
  Berkshire boar that had been used twenty-eight years before in giving
  size and constitution to the breed. I observed in the farmyard at Betley
  Hall some fowls showing a strong likeness to the Malay breed, and was
  told by Mr. Tollet that he had forty years before crossed his birds with
  Malays; and that, though he had at first attempted to get rid of this
  strain, he had subsequently given up the attempt in despair, as the Malay
  character would reappear.</p>

  <p>This strong tendency in crossed breeds to revert has given rise to
  endless discussions in how many generations after a single cross, either
  with a distinct breed or merely with an inferior animal, the breed may be
  considered as pure, and free from all danger of reversion. No one
  supposes that less than three generations suffices, and most breeders
  think that six, seven, or eight are necessary, and some go to still
  greater lengths.<a name="NtA_82" href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> But
  neither in the case of a breed which has been contaminated by a single
  cross, nor when, in the attempt to form an intermediate breed, half-bred
  animals have been matched together during many generations, can any rule
  be laid down how soon the tendency to reversion will be obliterated. It
  depends on the difference in the strength or prepotency of transmission
  in the two parent-forms, on their actual amount of difference, and on the
  nature of the conditions of life to which the crossed offspring are
  exposed. But we must be careful not to confound these cases of reversion
  to characters gained from a cross, with those given under the first
  class, in which characters originally common to <i>both</i> parents, but
  lost at some former period, reappear; for such characters may recur after
  an almost indefinite number of generations.</p>

<p><!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span></p>

  <p>The law of reversion is equally powerful with hybrids, when they are
  sufficiently fertile to breed together, or when they are repeatedly
  crossed with either pure parent-form, as with mongrels. It is not
  necessary to give instances, for in the case of plants almost every one
  who has worked on this subject from the time of Kölreuter to the present
  day has insisted on this tendency. Gärtner has recorded some good
  instances; but no one has given more striking cases than Naudin.<a
  name="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> The tendency differs in
  degree or strength in different groups, and partly depends, as we shall
  presently see, on the fact of the parent-plants having been long
  cultivated. Although the tendency to reversion is extremely general with
  nearly all mongrels and hybrids, it cannot be considered as invariably
  characteristic of them; there is, also, reason to believe that it may be
  mastered by long-continued selection; but these subjects will more
  properly be discussed in a future chapter on Crossing. From what we see
  of the power and scope of reversion, both in pure races and when
  varieties or species are crossed, we may infer that characters of almost
  every kind are capable of reappearance after having been lost for a great
  length of time. But it does not follow from this that in each particular
  case certain characters will reappear: for instance, this will not occur
  when a race is crossed with another endowed with prepotency of
  transmission. In some few cases the power of reversion wholly fails,
  without our being able to assign any cause for the failure: thus it has
  been stated that in a French family in which 85 out of above 600 members,
  during six generations, had been subject to night-blindness, "there has
  not been a single example of this affection in the children of parents
  who were themselves free from it."<a name="NtA_84"
  href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Reversion through Bud-propagation&mdash;Partial Reversion, by
  segments in the same flower or fruit, or in different parts of the <!--
  Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span>body in
  the same individual animal.</i>&mdash;In the eleventh chapter, many cases
  of reversion by buds, independently of seminal generation, were
  given&mdash;as when a leaf-bud on a variegated, curled, or laciniated
  variety suddenly reassumes its proper character; or as when a
  Provence-rose appears on a moss-rose, or a peach on a nectarine-tree. In
  some of these cases only half the flower or fruit, or a smaller segment,
  or mere stripes, reassumed their former character; and here we have with
  buds reversion by segments. Vilmorin<a name="NtA_85"
  href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> has also recorded several cases with
  plants derived from seed, of flowers reverting by stripes or blotches to
  their primitive colours: he states that in all such cases a white or
  pale-coloured variety must first be formed, and, when this is propagated
  for a length of time by seed, striped seedlings occasionally make their
  appearance; and these can afterwards by care be multiplied by seed.</p>

  <p>The stripes and segments just referred to are not due, as far as is
  known, to reversion to characters derived from a cross, but to characters
  lost by variation. These cases, however, as Naudin<a name="NtA_86"
  href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> insists in his discussion on
  disjunction of character, are closely analogous with those given in the
  eleventh chapter, in which crossed plants are known to have produced
  half-and-half or striped flowers and fruit, or distinct kinds of flowers
  on the same root resembling the two parent-forms. Many piebald animals
  probably come under this same head. Such cases, as we shall see in the
  chapter on Crossing, apparently result from certain characters not
  readily blending together, and, as a consequence of this incapacity for
  fusion, the offspring either perfectly resemble one of their two parents,
  or resemble one parent in one part and the other parent in another part;
  or whilst young are intermediate in character, but with advancing age
  revert wholly or by segments to either parent-form, or to both. Thus
  young trees of the <i>Cytisus adami</i> are intermediate in foliage and
  flowers between the two parent-forms; but when older the buds continually
  revert either partially or wholly to both forms. The cases given in the
  eleventh chapter on the changes which occurred during growth <!-- Page 38
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>in crossed
  plants of Tropæolum, Cereus, Datura, and Lathyrus are all analogous. As
  however these plants are hybrids of the first generation, and as their
  buds after a time come to resemble their parents and not their
  grandparents, these cases do not at first appear to come under the law of
  reversion in the ordinary sense of the word; nevertheless, as the change
  is effected through a succession of bud-generations on the same plant,
  they may be thus included.</p>

  <p>Analogous facts have been observed in the animal kingdom, and are more
  remarkable, as they occur strictly in the same individual, and not as
  with plants through a succession of bud-generations. With animals the act
  of reversion, if it can be so designated, does not pass over a true
  generation, but merely over the early stages of growth in the same
  individual. For instance, I crossed several white hens with a black cock,
  and many of the chickens were during the first year perfectly white, but
  acquired during the second year black feathers; on the other hand, some
  of the chickens which were at first black became during the second year
  piebald with white. A great breeder<a name="NtA_87"
  href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> says, that a Pencilled Brahma hen which
  has any of the blood of the Light Brahma in her, will "occasionally
  produce a pullet well pencilled during the first year, but she will most
  likely moult brown on the shoulders and become quite unlike her original
  colours in the second year." The same thing occurs with Light Brahmas if
  of impure blood. I have observed exactly similar cases with the crossed
  offspring from differently coloured pigeons. But here is a more
  remarkable fact: I crossed a turbit, which has a frill formed by the
  feathers being reversed on its breast, with a trumpeter; and one of the
  young pigeons thus raised showed at first not a trace of the frill, but,
  after moulting thrice, a small yet unmistakably distinct frill appeared
  on its breast. According to Girou,<a name="NtA_88"
  href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> calves produced from a red cow by a
  black bull, or from a black cow by a red bull, are not rarely born red,
  and subsequently become black.</p>

  <p>In the foregoing cases, the characters which appear with advancing age
  are the result of a cross in the previous or some <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span>former generation; but in
  the following cases, the characters which thus reappear formerly
  appertained to the species, and were lost at a more or less remote epoch.
  Thus, according to Azara,<a name="NtA_89"
  href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> the calves of a hornless race of cattle
  which originated in Corrientes, though at first quite hornless, as they
  become adult sometimes acquire small, crooked, and loose horns; and these
  in succeeding years occasionally become attached to the skull. White and
  black bantams, both of which generally breed true, sometimes assume as
  they grow old a saffron or red plumage. For instance, a first-rate black
  bantam has been described, which during three seasons was perfectly
  black, but then annually became more and more red; and it deserves notice
  that this tendency to change, whenever it occurs in a bantam, "is almost
  certain to prove hereditary."<a name="NtA_90"
  href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> The cuckoo or blue-mottled Dorking
  cock, when old, is liable to acquire yellow or orange hackles in place of
  his proper bluish-grey hackles.<a name="NtA_91"
  href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> Now, as <i>Gallus bankiva</i> is
  coloured red and orange, and as Dorking fowls and both kinds of bantams
  are descended from this species, we can hardly doubt that the change
  which occasionally occurs in the plumage of these birds as their age
  advances, results from a tendency in the individual to revert to the
  primitive type.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Crossing as a direct cause of Reversion.</i>&mdash;It has long been
  notorious that hybrids and mongrels often revert to both or to one of
  their parent-forms, after an interval of from two to seven or eight, or
  according to some authorities even a greater number of generations. But
  that the act of crossing in itself gives an impulse towards reversion, as
  shown by the reappearance of long-lost characters, has never, I believe,
  been hitherto proved. The proof lies in certain peculiarities, which do
  not characterise the immediate parents, and therefore cannot have been
  derived from them, frequently appearing in the offspring of two breeds
  when crossed, which peculiarities never appear, or appear with extreme
  rarity, in these same breeds, as long as they are <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span>precluded from crossing.
  As this conclusion seems to me highly curious and novel, I will give the
  evidence in detail.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>My attention was first called to this subject, and I was led to make
  numerous experiments, by MM. Boitard and Corbié having stated that, when
  they crossed certain breeds, pigeons coloured like the wild <i>C.
  livia</i>, or the common dovecot, namely, slaty-blue, with double black
  wing-bars, sometimes chequered with black, white loins, the tail barred
  with black, with the outer feathers edged with white, were almost
  invariably produced. The breeds which I crossed, and the remarkable
  results attained, have been fully described in the sixth chapter. I
  selected pigeons, belonging to true and ancient breeds, which had not a
  trace of blue or any of the above specified marks; but when crossed, and
  their mongrels recrossed, young birds were continually produced, more or
  less plainly coloured slaty-blue, with some or all of the proper
  characteristic marks. I may recall to the reader's memory one case,
  namely, that of a pigeon, hardly distinguishable from the wild Shetland
  species, the grandchild of a red-spot, white fantail, and two black
  barbs, from any of which, when purely-bred, the production of a pigeon
  coloured like the wild <i>C. livia</i> would have been almost a
  prodigy.</p>

  <p>I was thus led to make the experiments, recorded in the seventh
  chapter, on fowls. I selected long-established, pure breeds, in which
  there was not a trace of red, yet in several of the mongrels feathers of
  this colour appeared; and one magnificent bird, the offspring of a black
  Spanish cock and white Silk hen, was coloured almost exactly like the
  wild <i>Gallus bankiva</i>. All who know anything of the breeding of
  poultry will admit that tens of thousands of pure Spanish and of pure
  white Silk fowls might have been reared without the appearance of a red
  feather. The fact, given on the authority of Mr. Tegetmeier, of the
  frequent appearance, in mongrel fowls, of pencilled or
  transversely-barred feathers, like those common to many gallinaceous
  birds, is likewise apparently a case of reversion to a character formerly
  possessed by some ancient progenitor of the family. I owe to the kindness
  of this same excellent observer the inspection of some neck-hackles and
  tail-feathers from a hybrid between the common fowl and a very distinct
  species, the <i>Gallus varius</i>; and these feathers are transversely
  striped in a conspicuous manner with dark metallic blue and grey, a
  character which could not have been derived from either immediate
  parent.</p>

  <p>I have been informed by Mr. B. P. Brent, that he crossed a white
  Aylesbury drake and a black so-called Labrador duck, both of which are
  true breeds, and he obtained a young drake closely like the mallard
  (<i>A. boschas</i>). Of the musk-duck (<i>A. moschata</i>, Linn.) there
  are two sub-breeds, namely, white and slate-coloured; and these I am
  informed breed true, or nearly true. But the Rev. W.&nbsp;D. Fox tells me
  that, by putting a white drake to a slate-coloured duck, black birds,
  pied with white, like the wild musk-duck, were always produced.</p>

  <p>We have seen in the fourth chapter, that the so-called Himalayan
  rabbit, with its snow-white body, black ears, nose, tail, and feet,
  breeds <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>perfectly true. This race is known to have
  been formed by the union of two varieties of silver-grey rabbits. Now,
  when a Himalayan doe was crossed by a sandy-coloured buck, a silver-grey
  rabbit was produced; and this is evidently a case of reversion to one of
  the parent varieties. The young of the Himalayan rabbit are born
  snow-white, and the dark marks do not appear until some time
  subsequently; but occasionally young Himalayan rabbits are born of a
  light silver-grey, which colour soon disappears; so that here we have a
  trace of reversion, during an early period of life, to the
  parent-varieties, independently of any recent cross.</p>

  <p>In the third chapter is was shown that at an ancient period some
  breeds of cattle in the wilder parts of Britain were white with dark
  ears, and that the cattle now kept half wild in certain parks, and those
  which have run quite wild in two distant parts of the world, are likewise
  thus coloured. Now, an experienced breeder, Mr. J. Beasley, of
  Northamptonshire,<a name="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a>
  crossed some carefully selected West Highland cows with purely-bred
  shorthorn bulls. The bulls were red, red and white, or dark roan; and the
  Highland cows were all of a red colour, inclining to a light or yellow
  shade. But a considerable number of the offspring&mdash;and Mr. Beasley
  calls attention to this as a remarkable fact&mdash;were white, or white
  with red ears. Bearing in mind that none of the parents were white, and
  that they were purely-bred animals, it is highly probable that here the
  offspring reverted, in consequence of the cross, to the colour either of
  the aboriginal parent-species or of some ancient and half-wild
  parent-breed. The following case, perhaps, comes under the same head:
  cows in their natural state have their udders but little developed, and
  do not yield nearly so much milk as our domesticated animals. Now there
  is some reason to believe<a name="NtA_93"
  href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> that cross-bred animals between two
  kinds, both of which are good milkers, such as Alderneys and Shorthorns,
  often turn out worthless in this respect.</p>

  <p>In the chapter on the Horse reasons were assigned for believing that
  the primitive stock was striped and dun-coloured; and details were given,
  showing that in all parts of the world stripes of a dark colour
  frequently appear along the spine, across the legs, and on the shoulders,
  where they are occasionally double or treble, and even sometimes on the
  face and body of horses of all breeds and of all colours. But the stripes
  appear most frequently on the various kinds of duns. They may sometimes
  plainly be seen on foals, and subsequently disappear. The dun-colour and
  the stripes are strongly transmitted when a horse thus characterised is
  crossed with any other; but I was not able to prove that striped duns are
  generally produced from the crossing of two distinct breeds, neither of
  which are duns, though this does sometimes occur.</p>

  <p>The legs of the ass are often striped, and this may be considered as a
  reversion to the wild parent-form, the <i>Asinus tæniopus</i> of
  Abyssinia,<a name="NtA_94" href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> which is
  thus striped. In the domestic animal the stripes on the shoulder are
  occasionally double, or forked at the extremity, as in certain zebrine
  <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span>species. There is reason to believe that the
  foal is frequently more plainly striped on the legs than the adult
  animal. As with the horse, I have not acquired any distinct evidence that
  the crossing of differently-coloured varieties of the ass brings out the
  stripes.</p>

  <p>But now let us turn to the result of crossing the horse and ass.
  Although mules are not nearly so numerous in England as asses, I have
  seen a much greater number with striped legs, and with the stripes far
  more conspicuous than in either parent-form. Such mules are generally
  light-coloured, and might be called fallow-duns. The shoulder-stripe in
  one instance was deeply forked at the extremity, and in another instance
  was double, though united in the middle. Mr. Martin gives a figure of a
  Spanish mule with strong zebra-like marks on its legs,<a name="NtA_95"
  href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> and remarks, that mules are
  particularly liable to be thus striped on their legs. In South America,
  according to Roulin,<a name="NtA_96" href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a>
  such stripes are more frequent and conspicuous in the mule than in the
  ass. In the United States, Mr. Gosse,<a name="NtA_97"
  href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> speaking of these animals, says, "that
  in a great number, perhaps in nine out of every ten, the legs are banded
  with transverse dark stripes."</p>

  <p>Many years ago I saw in the Zoological Gardens a curious triple
  hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra.
  This animal when old had hardly any stripes; but I was assured by the
  superintendent, that when young it had shoulder-stripes, and faint
  stripes on its flanks and legs. I mention this case more especially as an
  instance of the stripes being much plainer during youth than in old
  age.</p>

  <p>As the zebra has such conspicuously striped legs, it might have been
  expected that the hybrids from this animal and the common ass would have
  had their legs in some degree striped; but it appears from the figures
  given in Dr. Gray's 'Knowsley Gleanings,' and still more plainly from
  that given by Geoffroy and F. Cuvier,<a name="NtA_98"
  href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> that the legs are much more
  conspicuously striped than the rest of the body; and this fact is
  intelligible only on the belief that the ass aids in giving, through the
  power of reversion, this character to its hybrid offspring.</p>

  <p>The quagga is banded over the whole front part of its body like a
  zebra, but has no stripes on its legs, or mere traces of them. But in the
  famous hybrid bred by Lord Morton,<a name="NtA_99"
  href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> from a chesnut, nearly purely-bred,
  Arabian mare, by a male quagga, the stripes were "more strongly defined
  and darker than those on the legs of the quagga." The mare was
  subsequently put to a black Arabian horse, and bore two colts, both of
  which, as formerly stated, were plainly striped on the legs, and one of
  them likewise had stripes on the neck and body.</p>

  <p>The <i>Asinus Indicus</i><a name="NtA_100"
  href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> is characterised by a spinal stripe,
  without shoulder <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>{43}</span>or leg stripes; but traces of these latter
  stripes may occasionally be seen even in the adult;<a name="NtA_101"
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> and Colonel S. Poole, who has had
  ample opportunities for observation, informs me that in the foal, when
  first born, the head and legs are often striped, but the shoulder-stripe
  is not so distinct as in the domestic ass; all these stripes, excepting
  that along the spine, soon disappear. Now a hybrid, raised at Knowsley<a
  name="NtA_102" href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> from a female of this
  species by a male domestic ass, had all four legs transversely and
  conspicuously striped, had three short stripes on each shoulder, and had
  even some zebra-like stripes on its face! Dr. Gray informs me that he has
  seen a second hybrid of the same parentage similarly striped.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From these facts we see that the crossing of the several equine
  species tends in a marked manner to cause stripes to appear on various
  parts of the body, especially on the legs. As we do not know whether the
  primordial parent of the genus was striped, the appearance of the stripes
  can only hypothetically be attributed to reversion. But most persons,
  after considering the many undoubted cases of variously coloured marks
  reappearing by reversion in crossed pigeons, fowls, ducks, &amp;c., will
  come to the same conclusion with respect to the horse-genus; and in this
  case we must admit that the progenitor of the group was striped on the
  legs, shoulders, face, and probably over the whole body, like a zebra. If
  we reject this view, the frequent and almost regular appearance of
  stripes in the several foregoing hybrids is left without any
  explanation.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It would appear that with crossed animals a similar tendency to the
  recovery of lost characters holds good even with instincts. There are
  some breeds of fowls which are called "everlasting layers," because they
  have lost the instinct of incubation; and so rare is it for them to
  incubate that I have seen notices published in works on poultry, when
  hens of such breeds have taken to sit.<a name="NtA_103"
  href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> Yet the aboriginal species was of
  course a good incubator; for with birds in a state of nature hardly any
  <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>instinct is so strong as this. Now, so many
  cases have been recorded of the crossed offspring from two races, neither
  of which are incubators, becoming first-rate sitters, that the
  reappearance of this instinct must be attributed to reversion from
  crossing. One author goes so far as to say, "that a cross between two
  non-sitting varieties almost invariably produces a mongrel that becomes
  broody, and sits with remarkable steadiness."<a name="NtA_104"
  href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> Another author, after giving a
  striking example, remarks that the fact can be explained only on the
  principle that "two negatives make a positive." It cannot, however, be
  maintained that hens produced from a cross between two non-sitting breeds
  invariably recover their lost instinct, any more than that crossed fowls
  or pigeons invariably recover the red or blue plumage of their
  prototypes. I raised several chickens from a Polish hen by a Spanish
  cock,&mdash;breeds which do not incubate,&mdash;and none of the young
  hens at first recovered their instinct, and this appeared to afford a
  well-marked exception to the foregoing rule; but one of these hens, the
  only one which was preserved, in the third year sat well on her eggs and
  reared a brood of chickens. So that here we have the appearance with
  advancing age of a primitive instinct, in the same manner as we have seen
  that the red plumage of the <i>Gallus bankiva</i> is sometimes reacquired
  by crossed and purely-bred fowls of various kinds as they grow old.</p>

  <p>The parents of all our domesticated animals were of course
  aboriginally wild in disposition; and when a domesticated species is
  crossed with a distinct species, whether this is a domesticated or only
  tamed animal, the hybrids are often wild <!-- Page 45 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span>to such a degree, that
  the fact is intelligible only on the principle that the cross has caused
  a partial return to the primitive disposition.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Powis formerly imported some thoroughly domesticated
  humped cattle from India, and crossed them with English breeds, which
  belong to a distinct species; and his agent remarked to me, without any
  question having been asked, how oddly wild the cross-bred animals were.
  The European wild boar and the Chinese domesticated pig are almost
  certainly specifically distinct: Sir F. Darwin crossed a sow of the
  latter breed with a wild Alpine boar which had become extremely tame, but
  the young, though having half-domesticated blood in their veins, were
  "extremely wild in confinement, and would not eat swill like common
  English pigs." Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience in crossing tame
  cock-pheasants with fowls belonging to five breeds, gives as the
  character of all "extraordinary wildness;"<a name="NtA_105"
  href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> but I have myself seen one exception
  to this rule. Mr. S.&nbsp;J. Salter,<a name="NtA_106"
  href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> who raised a large number of hybrids
  from a bantam-hen by <i>Gallus Sonneratii</i>, states that "all were
  exceedingly wild." Mr. Waterton<a name="NtA_107"
  href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> bred some wild ducks from eggs
  hatched under a common duck, and the young were allowed to cross freely
  both amongst themselves and with the tame ducks; they were "half wild and
  half tame; they came to the windows to be fed, but still they had a
  wariness about them quite remarkable."</p>

  <p>On the other hand, mules from the horse and ass are certainly not in
  the least wild, yet they are notorious for obstinacy and vice. Mr. Brent,
  who has crossed canary-birds with many kinds of finches, has not
  observed, as he informs me, that the hybrids were in any way remarkably
  wild. Hybrids are often raised between the common and musk duck, and I
  have been assured by three persons, who have kept these crossed birds,
  that they were not wild; but Mr. Garnett<a name="NtA_108"
  href="#Nt_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> observed that his female hybrids
  exhibited "migratory propensities," of which there is not a vestige in
  the common or musk duck. No case is <!-- Page 46 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>{46}</span>known of this latter bird
  having escaped and become wild in Europe or Asia, except, according to
  Pallas, on the Caspian Sea; and the common domestic duck only
  occasionally becomes wild in districts where large lakes and fens abound.
  Nevertheless, a large number of cases have been recorded<a name="NtA_109"
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> of hybrids from these two ducks,
  although so few are reared in comparison with purely-bred birds of either
  species, having been shot in a completely wild state. It is improbable
  that any of these hybrids could have acquired their wildness from the
  musk-duck having paired with a truly wild duck; and this is known not to
  be the case in North America; hence we must infer that they have
  reacquired, through reversion, their wildness, as well as renewed powers
  of flight.</p>

  <p>These latter facts remind us of the statements, so frequently made by
  travellers in all parts of the world, on the degraded state and savage
  disposition of crossed races of man. That many excellent and kind-hearted
  mulattos have existed no one will dispute; and a more mild and gentle set
  of men could hardly be found than the inhabitants of the island of
  Chiloe, who consist of Indians commingled with Spaniards in various
  proportions. On the other hand, many years ago, long before I had thought
  of the present subject, I was struck with the fact that, in South
  America, men of complicated descent between Negroes, Indians, and
  Spaniards, seldom had, whatever the cause might be, a good expression.<a
  name="NtA_110" href="#Nt_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> Livingstone,&mdash;and
  a more unimpeachable authority cannot be quoted,&mdash;after speaking of
  a half-caste man on the Zambesi, described by the Portuguese as a rare
  monster of inhumanity, remarks, "It is unaccountable why half-castes,
  such as he, are so much more cruel than the Portuguese, but such is
  undoubtedly the case." An inhabitant remarked to Livingstone, "God made
  white men, and God made black men, but the Devil made half-castes."<a
  name="NtA_111" href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> When two races, both
  <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>low
  in the scale, are crossed, the progeny seems to be eminently bad. Thus
  the noble-hearted Humboldt, who felt none of that prejudice against the
  inferior races now so current in England, speaks in strong terms of the
  bad and savage disposition of Zambos, or half-castes between Indians and
  Negroes; and this conclusion has been arrived at by various observers.<a
  name="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> From these facts we
  may perhaps infer that the degraded state of so many half-castes is in
  part due to reversion to a primitive and savage condition, induced by the
  act of crossing, as well as to the unfavourable moral conditions under
  which they generally exist.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Summary on the proximate causes leading to
  Reversion.</i>&mdash;When purely-bred animals or plants reassume
  long-lost characters,&mdash;when the common ass, for instance, is born
  with striped legs, when a pure race of black or white pigeons throws a
  slaty-blue bird, or when a cultivated heartsease with large and rounded
  flowers produces a seedling with small and elongated flowers,&mdash;we
  are quite unable to assign any proximate cause. When animals run wild,
  the tendency to reversion, which, though it has been greatly exaggerated,
  no doubt exists, is sometimes to a certain extent intelligible. Thus,
  with feral pigs, exposure to the weather will probably favour the growth
  of the bristles, as is known to be the case with the hair of other
  domesticated animals, and through correlation the tusks will tend to be
  redeveloped. But the reappearance of coloured longitudinal stripes on
  young feral pigs cannot be attributed to the direct action of external
  conditions. In this case, and in many others, we can only say that
  changed habits of life apparently have favoured a tendency, inherent or
  latent in the species, to return to the primitive state.</p>

  <p>It will be shown in a future chapter that the position of flowers on
  the summit of the axis, and the position of seeds within the capsule,
  sometimes determine a tendency towards reversion; and this apparently
  depends on the amount of sap or nutriment which the flower-buds and seeds
  receive. The position, also, of buds, either on branches or on roots,
  sometimes determines, as was formerly shown, the transmission of the <!--
  Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span>proper
  character of the variety, or its reversion to a former state.</p>

  <p>We have seen in the last section that when two races or species are
  crossed there is the strongest tendency to the reappearance in the
  offspring of long-lost characters, possessed by neither parent nor
  immediate progenitor. When two white, or red, or black pigeons, of
  well-established breeds, are united, the offspring are almost sure to
  inherit the same colours; but when differently-coloured birds are
  crossed, the opposed forces of inheritance apparently counteract each
  other, and the tendency which is inherent in both parents to produce
  slaty-blue offspring becomes predominant. So it is in several other
  cases. But when, for instance, the ass is crossed with <i>A. Indicus</i>
  or with the horse,&mdash;animals which have not striped legs,&mdash;and
  the hybrids have conspicuous stripes on their legs and even on their
  faces, all that can be said is, that an inherent tendency to reversion is
  evolved through some disturbance in the organisation caused by the act of
  crossing.</p>

  <p>Another form of reversion is far commoner, indeed is almost universal
  with the offspring from a cross, namely, to the characters proper to
  either pure parent-form. As a general rule, crossed offspring in the
  first generation are nearly intermediate between their parents, but the
  grandchildren and succeeding generations continually revert, in a greater
  or lesser degree, to one or both of their progenitors. Several authors
  have maintained that hybrids and mongrels include all the characters of
  both parents, not fused together, but merely mingled in different
  proportions in different parts of the body; or, as Naudin<a
  name="NtA_113" href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> has expressed it, a
  hybrid is a living mosaic-work, in which the eye cannot distinguish the
  discordant elements, so completely are they intermingled. We can hardly
  doubt that, in a certain sense, this is true, as when we behold in a
  hybrid the elements of both species segregating themselves into segments
  in the same flower or fruit, by a process of self-attraction or
  self-affinity; this segregation taking place either by seminal or by
  bud-propagation. Naudin further believes that the segregation of the two
  specific elements or essences is eminently liable to occur in the male
  and female reproductive matter; and he thus explains the almost <!-- Page
  49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>{49}</span>universal
  tendency to reversion in successive hybrid generations. For this would be
  the natural result of the union of pollen and ovules, in both of which
  the elements of the same species had been segregated by self-affinity.
  If, on the other hand, pollen which included the elements of one species
  happened to unite with ovules including the elements of the other
  species, the intermediate or hybrid state would still be retained, and
  there would be no reversion. But it would, as I suspect, be more correct
  to say that the elements of both parent-species exist in every hybrid in
  a double state, namely, blended together and completely separate. How
  this is possible, and what the term specific essence or element may be
  supposed to express, I shall attempt to show in the hypothetical chapter
  on pangenesis.</p>

  <p>But Naudin's view, as propounded by him, is not applicable to the
  reappearance of characters lost long ago by variation; and it is hardly
  applicable to races or species which, after having been crossed at some
  former period with a distinct form, and having since lost all traces of
  the cross, nevertheless occasionally yield an individual which reverts
  (as in the case of the great-great-grandchild of the pointer Sappho) to
  the crossing form. The most simple case of reversion, namely, of a hybrid
  or mongrel to its grandparents, is connected by an almost perfect series
  with the extreme case of a purely-bred race recovering characters which
  had been lost during many ages; and we are thus led to infer that all the
  cases must be related by some common bond.</p>

  <p>Gärtner believed that only those hybrid plants which are highly
  sterile exhibit any tendency to reversion to their parent-forms. It is
  rash to doubt so good an observer, but this conclusion must I think be an
  error; and it may perhaps be accounted for by the nature of the genera
  observed by him, for he admits that the tendency differs in different
  genera. The statement is also directly contradicted by Naudin's
  observations, and by the notorious fact that perfectly fertile mongrels
  exhibit the tendency in a high degree,&mdash;even in a higher degree,
  according to Gärtner himself, than hybrids.<a name="NtA_114"
  href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Gärtner further states that reversions rarely occur with <!-- Page 50
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>hybrid plants
  raised from species which have not been cultivated, whilst, with those
  which have been long cultivated, they are of frequent occurrence. This
  conclusion explains a curious discrepancy: Max Wichura,<a name="NtA_115"
  href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> who worked exclusively on willows,
  which had not been subjected to culture, never saw an instance of
  reversion; and he goes so far as to suspect that the careful Gärtner had
  not sufficiently protected his hybrids from the pollen of the
  parent-species: Naudin, on the other hand, who chiefly experimented on
  cucurbitaceous and other cultivated plants, insists more strenuously than
  any other author on the tendency to reversion in all hybrids. The
  conclusion that the condition of the parent-species, as affected by
  culture, is one of the proximate causes leading to reversion, agrees
  fairly well with the converse case of domesticated animals and cultivated
  plants being liable to reversion when they become feral; for in both
  cases the organisation or constitution must be disturbed, though in a
  very different way.</p>

  <p>Finally, we have seen that characters often reappear in purely-bred
  races without our being able to assign any proximate cause; but when they
  become feral this is either indirectly or directly induced by the change
  in their conditions of life. With crossed breeds, the act of crossing in
  itself certainly leads to the recovery of long-lost characters, as well
  as of those derived from either parent-form. Changed conditions,
  consequent on cultivation, and the relative position of buds, flowers,
  and seeds on the plant, all apparently aid in giving this same tendency.
  Reversion may occur either through seminal or bud generation, generally
  at birth, but sometimes only with an advance of age. Segments or portions
  of the individual may alone be thus affected. That a being should be born
  resembling in certain characters an ancestor removed by two or three, and
  in some cases by hundreds or even thousands of generations, is assuredly
  a wonderful fact. In these cases the child is commonly said to inherit
  such characters directly from its grandparents or more remote ancestors.
  But this view is hardly conceivable. If, however, we suppose that every
  character is derived <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page51"></a>{51}</span>exclusively from the father or mother, but
  that many characters lie latent in both parents during a long succession
  of generations, the foregoing facts are intelligible. In what manner
  characters may be conceived to lie latent, will be considered in a future
  chapter to which I have lately alluded.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Latent Characters.</i>&mdash;But I must explain what is meant by
  characters lying latent. The most obvious illustration is afforded by
  secondary sexual characters. In every female all the secondary male
  characters, and in every male all the secondary female characters,
  apparently exist in a latent state, ready to be evolved under certain
  conditions. It is well known that a large number of female birds, such as
  fowls, various pheasants, partridges, peahens, ducks, &amp;c., when old
  or diseased, or when operated on, partly assume the secondary male
  characters of their species. In the case of the hen-pheasant this has
  been observed to occur far more frequently during certain seasons than
  during others.<a name="NtA_116" href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> A
  duck ten years old has been known to assume both the perfect winter and
  summer plumage of the drake.<a name="NtA_117"
  href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> Waterton<a name="NtA_118"
  href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> gives a curious case of a hen which
  had ceased laying, and had assumed the plumage, voice, spurs, and warlike
  disposition of the cock; when opposed to an enemy she would erect her
  hackles and show fight. Thus every character, even to the instinct and
  manner of fighting, must have lain dormant in this hen as long as her
  ovaria continued to act. The females of two kinds of deer, when old, have
  been known to acquire horns; and, as Hunter has remarked, we see
  something of an analogous nature in the human species.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, with male animals, it is notorious that the
  secondary sexual characters are more or less completely lost when they
  are subjected to castration. Thus, if the operation be performed on a
  young cock, he never, as Yarrell states, crows <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>again; the comb, wattles,
  and spurs do not grow to their full size, and the hackles assume an
  intermediate appearance between true hackles and the feathers of the hen.
  Cases are recorded of confinement alone causing analogous results. But
  characters properly confined to the female are likewise acquired; the
  capon takes to sitting on eggs, and will bring up chickens; and what is
  more curious, the utterly sterile male hybrids from the pheasant and the
  fowl act in the same manner, "their delight being to watch when the hens
  leave their nests, and to take on themselves the office of a sitter."<a
  name="NtA_119" href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> That admirable
  observer Réaumur<a name="NtA_120" href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a>
  asserts that a cock, by being long confined in solitude and darkness, can
  be taught to take charge of young chickens; he then utters a peculiar
  cry, and retains during his whole life this newly acquired maternal
  instinct. The many well-ascertained cases of various male mammals giving
  milk, show that their rudimentary mammary glands retain this capacity in
  a latent condition.</p>

  <p>We thus see that in many, probably in all cases, the secondary
  characters of each sex lie dormant or latent in the opposite sex, ready
  to be evolved under peculiar circumstances. We can thus understand how,
  for instance, it is possible for a good milking cow to transmit her good
  qualities through her male offspring to future generations; for we may
  confidently believe that these qualities are present, though latent, in
  the males of each generation. So it is with the game-cock, who can
  transmit his superiority in courage and vigour through his female to his
  male offspring; and with man it is known <a name="NtA_121"
  href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> that diseases, such as hydrocele,
  necessarily confined to the male sex, can be transmitted through the
  female to the grandson. Such cases as these offer, as was remarked at the
  commencement of this chapter, the simplest possible examples of
  reversion; and they are intelligible on the belief that characters common
  to the grandparent and grandchild of the same sex are present, though
  latent, in the intermediate parent of the opposite sex.</p>

  <p>The subject of latent characters is so important, as we shall see in a
  future chapter, that I will give another illustration. <!-- Page 53
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>{53}</span>Many animals
  have the right and left sides of their body unequally developed: this is
  well known to be the case with flat-fish, in which the one side differs
  in thickness and colour, and in the shape of the fins, from the other;
  and during the growth of the young fish one eye actually travels, as
  shown by Steenstrup, from the lower to the upper surface.<a
  name="NtA_122" href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> In most flat-fishes
  the left is the blind side, but in some it is the right; though in both
  cases "wrong fishes," which are developed in a reversed manner to what is
  usual, occasionally occur, and in <i>Platessa flesus</i> the right or
  left side is indifferently developed, the one as often as the other. With
  gasteropods or shell-fish, the right and left sides are extremely
  unequal; the far greater number of species are dextral, with rare and
  occasional reversals of development, and some few are normally sinistral;
  but certain species of Bulimus, and, many Achatinellæ,<a name="NtA_123"
  href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> are as often sinistral as dextral. I
  will give an analogous case in the great Articulate kingdom: the two
  sides of Verruca<a name="NtA_124" href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> are
  so wonderfully unlike, that without careful dissection it is extremely
  difficult to recognise the corresponding parts on the opposite sides of
  the body; yet it is apparently a mere matter of chance whether it be the
  right or the left side that undergoes so singular an amount of change.
  One plant is known to me<a name="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> in which the flower, according as it
  stands on the one or other side of the spike, is unequally developed. In
  all the foregoing cases the two sides of the animal are perfectly
  symmetrical at an early period of growth. Now, whenever a species is as
  liable to be unequally developed on the one as on the other side, we may
  infer that the capacity for such development is present, though latent,
  in the undeveloped side. And as a reversal of development occasionally
  occurs in animals of many kinds, this latent capacity is probably very
  common.</p>

  <p>The best yet simplest instances of characters lying dormant are,
  perhaps, those previously given, in which chickens and <!-- Page 54
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span>young pigeons,
  raised from a cross between differently coloured birds, are at first of
  one colour, but in a year or two acquire feathers of the colour of the
  other parent; for in this case the tendency to a change of plumage is
  clearly latent in the young bird. So it is with hornless breeds of
  cattle, some of which acquire, as they grow old, small horns. Purely bred
  black and white bantams, and some other fowls, occasionally assume, with
  advancing years, the red feathers of the parent-species. I will here add
  a somewhat different case, as it connects in a striking manner latent
  characters of two classes. Mr. Hewitt<a name="NtA_126"
  href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> possessed an excellent Sebright
  gold-laced hen bantam, which, as she became old, grew diseased in her
  ovaria, and assumed male characters. In this breed the males resemble the
  females in all respects except in their combs, wattles, spurs, and
  instincts; hence it might have been expected that the diseased hen would
  have assumed only those masculine characters which are proper to the
  breed, but she acquired, in addition, well-arched tail sickle-feathers
  quite a foot in length, saddle-feathers on the loins, and hackles on the
  neck,&mdash;ornaments which, as Mr. Hewitt remarks, "would be held as
  abominable in this breed." The Sebright bantam is known<a name="NtA_127"
  href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> to have originated about the year
  1800 from a cross between a common bantam and a Polish fowl, recrossed by
  a hen-tailed bantam, and carefully selected; hence there can hardly be a
  doubt that the sickle-feathers and hackles which appeared in the old hen
  were derived from the Polish fowl or common bantam; and we thus see that
  not only certain masculine characters proper to the Sebright bantam, but
  other masculine characters derived from the first progenitors of the
  breed, removed by a period of above sixty years, were lying latent in
  this hen-bird, ready to be evolved as soon as her ovaria became
  diseased.</p>

  <p>From these several facts it must be admitted that certain characters,
  capacities, and instincts may lie latent in an individual, and even in a
  succession of individuals, without our being able to detect the least
  signs of their presence. We have <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>{55}</span>already seen that the transmission of a
  character from the grandparent to the grandchild, with its apparent
  omission in the intermediate parent of the opposite sex, becomes simple
  on this view. When fowls, pigeons, or cattle of different colours are
  crossed, and their offspring change colour as they grow old, or when the
  crossed turbit acquired the characteristic frill after its third moult,
  or when purely-bred bantams partially assume the red plumage of their
  prototype, we cannot doubt that these qualities were from the first
  present, though latent, in the individual animal, like the characters of
  a moth in the caterpillar. Now, if these animals had produced offspring
  before they had acquired with advancing age their new characters, nothing
  is more probable than that they would have transmitted them to some of
  their offspring, which in this case would in appearance have received
  such characters from their grandparents or more distant progenitors. We
  should then have had a case of reversion, that is, of the reappearance in
  the child of an ancestral character, actually present, though during
  youth completely latent, in the parent; and this we may safely conclude
  is what occurs with reversions of all kinds to progenitors however
  remote.</p>

  <p>This view of the latency in each generation of all the characters
  which appear through reversion, is also supported by their actual
  presence in some cases during early youth alone, or by their more
  frequent appearance and greater distinctness at this age than during
  maturity. We have seen that this is often the case with the stripes on
  the legs and faces of the several species of the horse-genus. The
  Himalayan rabbit, when crossed, sometimes produces offspring which revert
  to the parent silver-grey breed, and we have seen that in purely bred
  animals pale-grey fur occasionally reappears during early youth. Black
  cats, we may feel assured, would occasionally produce by reversion
  tabbies; and on young black kittens, with a pedigree<a name="NtA_128"
  href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> known to have been long pure, faint
  traces of stripes may almost always be seen which afterwards disappear.
  Hornless Suffolk cattle occasionally produce by reversion horned animals;
  and Youatt<a name="NtA_129" href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> asserts
  that even in hornless individuals <!-- Page 56 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span>"the rudiment of a horn
  may be often felt at an early age."</p>

  <p>No doubt it appears at first sight in the highest degree improbable
  that in every horse of every generation there should be a latent capacity
  and tendency to produce stripes, though these may not appear once in a
  thousand generations; that in every white, black, or other coloured
  pigeon, which may have transmitted its proper colour during centuries,
  there should be a latent capacity in the plumage to become blue and to be
  marked with certain characteristic bars; that in every child in a
  six-fingered family there should be the capacity for the production of an
  additional digit; and so in other cases. Nevertheless there is no more
  inherent improbability in this being the case than in a useless and
  rudimentary organ, or even in only a tendency to the production of a
  rudimentary organ, being inherited during millions of generations, as is
  well known to occur with a multitude of organic beings. There is no more
  inherent improbability in each domestic pig, during a thousand
  generations, retaining the capacity and tendency to develop great tusks
  under fitting conditions, than in the young calf having retained for an
  indefinite number of generations rudimentary incisor teeth, which never
  protrude through the gums.</p>

  <p>I shall give at the end of the next chapter a summary of the three
  preceding chapters; but as isolated and striking cases of reversion have
  here been chiefly insisted on, I wish to guard the reader against
  supposing that reversion is due to some rare or accidental combination of
  circumstances. When a character, lost during hundreds of generations,
  suddenly reappears, no doubt some such combination must occur; but
  reversions may be constantly observed, at least to the immediately
  preceding generations, in the offspring of most unions. This has been
  universally recognised in the case of hybrids and mongrels, but it has
  been recognised simply from the difference between the united forms
  rendering the resemblance of the offspring to their grandparents or more
  remote progenitors of easy detection. Reversion is likewise almost
  invariably the rule, as Mr. Sedgwick has shown, with certain diseases.
  Hence we must conclude that a tendency to this peculiar form of
  transmission is an integral part of the general law of inheritance. <!--

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Monstrosities.</i>&mdash;A large number of monstrous growths and of
  lesser anomalies are admitted by every one to be due to an arrest of
  development, that is to the persistence of an embryonic condition. If
  every horse or ass had striped legs whilst young, the stripes which
  occasionally appear on these animals when adult would have to be
  considered as due to the anomalous retention of an early character, and
  not as due to reversion. Now, the leg-stripes in the horse-genus, and
  some other characters in analogous cases, are apt to occur during early
  youth and then to disappear; thus the persistence of early characters and
  reversion are brought into close connexion.</p>

  <p>But many monstrosities can hardly be considered as the result of an
  arrest of development; for parts of which no trace can be detected in the
  embryo, but which occur in other members of the same class of animals or
  plants, occasionally appear, and these may probably with truth be
  attributed to reversion. For instance: supernumerary mammæ, capable of
  secreting milk, are not extremely rare in women; and as many as five have
  been observed. When four are developed, they are generally arranged
  symmetrically on each side of the chest; and in one instance a woman (the
  daughter of another with supernumerary mammæ) had one mamma, which
  yielded milk, developed in the inguinal region. This latter case, when we
  remember the position of the mammæ in some of the lower animals on both
  the chest and inguinal region, is highly remarkable, and leads to the
  belief that in all cases the additional mammæ in woman are due to
  reversion. The facts given in the last chapter on the tendency in
  supernumerary digits to regrowth after amputation, indicate their
  relation to the digits of the lower vertebrate animals, and lead to the
  suspicion that their appearance may in some manner be connected with
  reversion. But I shall have to recur, in the chapter on pangenesis, to
  the abnormal multiplication of organs, and likewise to their occasional
  transposition. The occasional development in man of the coccygeal
  vertebræ into a short and free tail, though it thus becomes in one sense
  more perfectly developed, may at the same time be considered as an arrest
  of development, and as a case of reversion. The greater frequency of a
  monstrous kind of proboscis in the pig than in any other mammal,
  considering the position of the pig <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>in the mammalian series,
  has likewise been attributed, perhaps truly, to reversion.<a
  name="NtA_130" href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>When flowers which are properly irregular in structure become regular
  or peloric, the change is generally looked at by botanists as a return to
  the primitive state. But Dr. Maxwell Masters,<a name="NtA_131"
  href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> who has ably discussed this subject,
  remarks that when, for instance, all the sepals of a Tropæolum become
  green and of the same shape, instead of being coloured with one alone
  prolonged into a spur, or when all the petals of a Linaria become simple
  and regular, such cases may be due merely to an arrest of development;
  for in these flowers all the organs during their earliest condition are
  symmetrical, and, if arrested at this stage of growth, they would not
  become irregular. If, moreover, the arrest were to take place at a still
  earlier period of development, the result would be a simple tuft of green
  leaves; and no one probably would call this a case of reversion. Dr.
  Masters designates the cases first alluded to as regular peloria; and
  others, in which all the corresponding parts assume a similar form of
  irregularity, as when all the petals in a Linaria become spurred, as
  irregular peloria. We have no right to attribute these latter cases to
  reversion, until it can be shown to be probable that the parent-form, for
  instance, of the genus Linaria had had all its petals spurred; for a
  change of this nature might result from the spreading of an anomalous
  structure, in accordance with the law, to be discussed in a future
  chapter, of homologous parts tending to vary in the same manner. But as
  both forms of peloria frequently occur on the same individual plant of
  the Linaria,<a name="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> they
  probably stand in some close relation to each other. On the doctrine that
  peloria is simply the result of an arrest of development, it is difficult
  to understand how an organ arrested at a very early period of growth
  should acquire its full functional perfection;&mdash;how a petal,
  supposed to be thus arrested, should acquire its brilliant colours, and
  serve as an envelope to the flower, or a stamen produce efficient pollen;
  yet this occurs with many peloric flowers. That pelorism is not due to
  mere chance variability, but either to an arrest of development or to
  reversion, we may infer from an observation made by Ch. Morren,<a
  name="NtA_133" href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> namely, that families
  which have irregular flowers often "return by these monstrous growths to
  their regular form; whilst we never see a regular flower realise the
  structure of an irregular one."</p>

  <p>Some flowers have almost certainly become more or less completely
  peloric through reversion. <i>Corydalis tuberosa</i> properly has one of
  its two nectaries colourless, destitute of nectar, only half the size of
  the other, and <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>therefore, to a certain extent, in a
  rudimentary state; the pistil is curved towards the perfect nectary, and
  the hood, formed of the inner petals, slips off the pistil and stamens in
  one direction alone, so that, when a bee sucks the perfect nectary, the
  stigma and stamens are exposed and rubbed against the insect's body. In
  several closely allied genera, as in Dielytra, &amp;c., there are two
  perfect nectaries, the pistil is straight, and the hood slips off on
  either side, according as the bee sucks either nectary. Now, I have
  examined several flowers of <i>Corydalis tuberosa</i>, in which both
  nectaries were equally developed and contained nectar; in this we see
  only the redevelopment of a partially aborted organ; but with this
  redevelopment the pistil becomes straight, and the hood slips off in
  either direction; so that these flowers have acquired the perfect
  structure, so well adapted for insect agency, of Dielytra and its allies.
  We cannot attribute these coadapted modifications to chance, or to
  correlated variability; we must attribute them to reversion to a
  primordial condition of the species.</p>

  <p>The peloric flowers of Pelargonium have their five petals in all
  respects alike, and there is no nectary; so that they resemble the
  symmetrical flowers of the closely allied Geranium-genus; but the
  alternate stamens are also sometimes destitute of anthers, the shortened
  filaments being left as rudiments, and in this respect they resemble the
  symmetrical flowers of the closely allied genus, Erodium. Hence we are
  led to look at the peloric flowers of Pelargonium as having probably
  reverted to the state of some primordial form, the progenitor of the
  three closely related genera of Pelargonium, Geranium, and Erodium.</p>

  <p>In the peloric form of <i>Antirrhinum majus</i>, appropriately called
  the "<i>Wonder</i>," the tubular and elongated flowers differ wonderfully
  from those of the common snapdragon; the calyx and the mouth of the
  corolla consist of six equal lobes, and include six equal instead of four
  unequal stamens. One of the two additional stamens is manifestly formed
  by the development of a microscopically minute papilla, which may be
  found at the base of the upper lip of the flower in all common
  snapdragons, at least in nineteen plants examined by me. That this
  papilla is a rudiment of a stamen was well shown by its various degrees
  of development in crossed plants between the common and peloric
  Antirrhinum. Again, a peloric <i>Galeobdolon luteum</i>, growing in my
  garden, had five equal petals, all striped like the ordinary lower lip,
  and included five equal instead of four unequal stamens; but Mr. R.
  Keeley, who sent me this plant, informs me that the flowers vary greatly,
  having from four to six lobes to the corolla, and from three to six
  stamens.<a name="NtA_134" href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> Now, as the
  members of the two great families to which the Antirrhinum and
  Galeobdolon belong are properly pentamerous, with some of the parts
  confluent and others suppressed, we ought not to look at the sixth stamen
  and the sixth lobe to the corolla in either case as due to reversion, any
  more than the additional petals in double flowers in these same two
  families. But the case is different with the fifth stamen in the peloric
  Antirrhinum, which <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span>is produced by the redevelopment of a
  rudiment always present, and which probably reveals to us the state of
  the flower, as far as the stamens are concerned, at some ancient epoch.
  It is also difficult to believe that the other four stamens and the
  petals, after an arrest of development at a very early embryonic age,
  would have come to full perfection in colour, structure, and function,
  unless these organs had at some former period normally passed through a
  similar course of growth. Hence it appears to me probable that the
  progenitor of the genus Antirrhinum must at some remote epoch have
  included five stamens and borne flowers in some degree resembling those
  now produced by the peloric form.</p>

  <p>Lastly, I may add that many instances have been recorded of flowers,
  not generally ranked as peloric, in which certain organs, normally few in
  number, have been abnormally augmented. As such an increase of parts
  cannot be looked at as an arrest of development, nor as due to the
  redevelopment of rudiments, for no rudiments are present, and as these
  additional parts bring the plant into closer relationship with its
  natural allies, they ought probably to be viewed as reversions to a
  primordial condition.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These several facts show us in an interesting manner how intimately
  certain abnormal states are connected together; namely, arrests of
  development causing parts to become rudimentary or to be wholly
  suppressed,&mdash;the redevelopment of parts at present in a more or less
  rudimentary condition,&mdash;the reappearance of organs of which not a
  vestige can now be detected,&mdash;and to these may be added, in the case
  of animals, the presence during youth, and subsequent disappearance, of
  certain characters which occasionally are retained throughout life. Some
  naturalists look at all such abnormal structures as a return to the ideal
  state of the group to which the affected being belongs; but it is
  difficult to conceive what is meant to be conveyed by this expression.
  Other naturalists maintain, with greater probability and distinctness of
  view, that the common bond of connection between the several foregoing
  cases is an actual, though partial, return to the structure of the
  ancient progenitor of the group. If this view be correct, we must believe
  that a vast number of characters, capable of evolution, lie hidden in
  every organic being. But it would be a mistake to suppose that the number
  is equally great in all beings. We know, for instance, that plants of
  many orders occasionally become peloric; but many more cases have been
  observed in the Labiatæ and Scrophulariaceæ than in any other order; and
  in one genus of the Scrophulariaceæ, namely Linaria, no less <!-- Page 61
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>than thirteen
  species have been described in a peloric condition.<a name="NtA_135"
  href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> On this view of the nature of peloric
  flowers, and <span class="correction" title="Original reads `bearnig'."
  >bearing</span> in mind what has been said with respect to certain
  monstrosities in the animal kingdom, we must conclude that the
  progenitors of most plants and animals, though widely different in
  structure, have left an impression capable of redevelopment on the germs
  of their descendants.</p>

  <p>The fertilised germ of one of the higher animals, subjected as it is
  to so vast a series of changes from the germinal cell to old
  age,&mdash;incessantly agitated by what Quatrefages well calls the
  <i>tourbillon vital</i>,&mdash;is perhaps the most wonderful object in
  nature. It is probable that hardly a change of any kind affects either
  parent, without some mark being left on the germ. But on the doctrine of
  reversion, as given in this chapter, the germ becomes a far more
  marvellous object, for, besides the visible changes to which it is
  subjected, we must believe that it is crowded with invisible characters,
  proper to both sexes, to both the right and left side of the body, and to
  a long line of male and female ancestors separated by hundreds or even
  thousands of generations from the present time; and these characters,
  like those written on paper with invisible ink, all lie ready to be
  evolved under certain known or unknown conditions.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the two last chapters the nature and force of Inheritance, the
  circumstances which interfere with its power, and the tendency to
  Reversion, with its many remarkable contingencies, were discussed. In the
  present chapter some other related phenomena will be treated of, as fully
  as my materials permit.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Fixedness of Character.</i></p>

  <p>It is a general belief amongst breeders that the longer any character
  has been transmitted by a breed, the more firmly it will continue to be
  transmitted. I do not wish to dispute the truth of the proposition, that
  inheritance gains strength simply through long continuance, but I doubt
  whether it can be proved. In one sense the proposition is little better
  than a truism; if any character has remained constant during many
  generations, it will obviously be little likely, the conditions of life
  remaining the same, to vary during the next generation. So, again, in
  improving a breed, if care be taken for a length of time to exclude all
  inferior individuals, the breed will obviously tend to become truer, as
  it will not have been crossed during many generations by an inferior
  animal. We have previously seen, <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>{63}</span>but without being able to assign any cause,
  that, when a new character appears, it is occasionally from the first
  well fixed, or fluctuates much, or wholly fails to be transmitted. So it
  is with the aggregate of slight differences which characterise a new
  variety, for some propagate their kind from the first much truer than
  others. Even with plants multiplied by bulbs, layers, &amp;c., which may
  in one sense be said to form parts of the same individual, it is well
  known that certain varieties retain and transmit through successive
  bud-generations their newly-acquired characters more truly than others.
  In none of these, nor in the following cases, does there appear to be any
  relation between the force with which a character is transmissible and
  the length of time during which it has already been transmitted. Some
  varieties, such as white and yellow hyacinths and white sweet-peas,
  transmit their colours more faithfully than do the varieties which have
  retained their natural colour. In the Irish family, mentioned in the
  twelfth chapter, the peculiar tortoiseshell-like colouring of the eyes
  was transmitted far more faithfully than any ordinary colour. Ancon and
  Mauchamp sheep and niata cattle, which are all comparatively modern
  breeds, exhibit remarkably strong powers of inheritance. Many similar
  cases could be adduced.</p>

  <p>As all domesticated animals and cultivated plants have varied, and yet
  are descended from aboriginally wild forms, which no doubt had retained
  the same character from an immensely remote epoch, we see that scarcely
  any degree of antiquity ensures a character being transmitted perfectly
  true. In this case, however, it may be said that changed conditions of
  life induce certain modifications, and not that the power of inheritance
  fails; but in every case of failure, some cause, either internal or
  external, must interfere. It will generally be found that the parts in
  our domesticated productions which have varied, or which still continue
  to vary,&mdash;that is, which fail to retain their primordial
  state,&mdash;are the same with the parts which differ in the natural
  species of the same genus. As, on the theory of descent with
  modification, the species of the same genus have been modified since they
  branched off from a common progenitor, it follows that the characters by
  which they differ from each other have varied whilst other parts of the
  organisation have remained unchanged; and it might be argued that <!--
  Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span>these
  same characters now vary under domestication, or fail to be inherited,
  owing to their lesser antiquity. But we must believe structures, which
  have already varied, would be more liable to go on varying, rather than
  structures which during an immense lapse of time have remained unaltered;
  and this variation is probably the result of certain relations between
  the conditions of life and the organisation, quite independently of the
  greater or less antiquity of each particular character.</p>

  <p>Fixedness of character, or the strength of inheritance, has often been
  judged of by the preponderance of certain characters in the crossed
  offspring between distinct races; but prepotency of transmission here
  comes into play, and this, as we shall immediately see, is a very
  different consideration from the strength or weakness of inheritance. It
  has often been observed<a name="NtA_136"
  href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> that breeds of animals inhabiting
  wild and mountainous countries cannot be permanently modified by our
  improved breeds; and as these latter are of modern origin, it has been
  thought that the greater antiquity of the wilder breeds has been the
  cause of their resistance to improvement by crossing; but it is more
  probably due to their structure and constitution being better adapted to
  the surrounding conditions. When plants are first subjected to culture,
  it has been found that, during several generations, they transmit their
  characters truly, that is, do not vary, and this has been attributed to
  ancient characters being strongly inherited; but it may with equal or
  greater probability be consequent on changed conditions of life requiring
  a long time for their accumulative action. Notwithstanding these
  considerations, it would perhaps be rash to deny that characters become
  more strongly fixed the longer they are transmitted; but I believe that
  the proposition resolves itself into this,&mdash;that all characters of
  all kinds, whether new or old, tend to be inherited, and that those which
  have already withstood all counteracting influences and been truly
  transmitted, will, as a general rule, continue to withstand them, and
  consequently be faithfully inherited.</p>

<p><!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Prepotency in the Transmission of Character.</i></p>

  <p>When individuals distinct enough to be recognised, but of the same
  family, or when two well-marked races, or two species, are crossed, the
  usual result, as stated in the previous chapter, is, that the offspring
  in the first generation are intermediate between their parents, or
  resemble one parent in one part and the other parent in another part. But
  this is by no means the invariable rule; for in many cases it is found
  that certain individuals, races, and species are prepotent in
  transmitting their likeness. This subject has been ably discussed by
  Prosper Lucas,<a name="NtA_137" href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> but
  is rendered extremely complicated by the prepotency sometimes running
  equally in both sexes, and sometimes more strongly in one sex than in the
  other; it is likewise complicated by the presence of secondary sexual
  characters, which render the comparison of mongrels with their
  parent-breeds difficult.</p>

  <p>It would appear that in certain families some one ancestor, and after
  him others in the same family, must have had great power in transmitting
  their likeness through the male line; for we cannot otherwise understand
  how the same features should so often be transmitted after marriages with
  various females, as has been the case with the Austrian Emperors, and as,
  according to Niebuhr, formerly occurred in certain Roman families with
  their mental qualities.<a name="NtA_138"
  href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> The famous bull Favourite is
  believed<a name="NtA_139" href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> to have had
  a prepotent influence on the shorthorn race. It has also been observed<a
  name="NtA_140" href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> with English
  race-horses that certain mares have generally transmitted their own
  character, whilst other mares of equally pure blood have allowed the
  character of the sire to prevail.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The truth of the principle of prepotency comes out more clearly when
  certain races are crossed. The improved Shorthorns, notwithstanding that
  the breed is comparatively modern, are generally acknowledged to possess
  great power in impressing their likeness on all other breeds; and it is
  chiefly in consequence of this power that they are so highly valued <!--
  Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>for
  exportation.<a name="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> Godine
  has given a curious case of a ram of a goat-like breed of sheep from the
  Cape of Good Hope, which produced offspring hardly to be distinguished
  from himself, when crossed with ewes of twelve other breeds. But two of
  these half-bred ewes, when put to a merino ram, produced lambs closely
  resembling the merino breed. Girou de Buzareingues<a name="NtA_142"
  href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> found that of two races of French
  sheep the ewes of one, when crossed during successive generations with
  merino rams, yielded up their character far sooner than the ewes of the
  other race. Sturm and Girou have given analogous cases with other breeds
  of sheep and with cattle, the prepotency running in these cases through
  the male side; but I was assured on good authority in South America, that
  when niata cattle are crossed with common cattle, though the niata breed
  is prepotent whether males or females are used, yet that the prepotency
  is strongest through the female line. The Manx cat is tailless and has
  long hind legs; Dr. Wilson crossed a male Manx with common cats, and, out
  of twenty-three kittens, seventeen were destitute of tails; but when the
  female Manx was crossed by common male cats all the kittens had tails,
  though they were generally short and imperfect.<a name="NtA_143"
  href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In making reciprocal crosses between pouter and fantail pigeons, the
  pouter-race seemed to be prepotent through both sexes over the fantail.
  But this is probably due to weak power in the fantail rather than to any
  unusually strong power in the pouter, for I have observed that barbs also
  preponderated over fantails. This weakness of transmission in the
  fantail, though the breed is an ancient one, is said<a name="NtA_144"
  href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> to be general; but I have observed
  one exception to the rule, namely, in a cross between a fantail and
  laugher. The most curious instance known to me of weak power in both
  sexes is in the trumpeter pigeon. This breed has been well known for at
  least 130 years: it breeds perfectly true, as I have been assured by
  those who have long kept many birds: it is characterised by a peculiar
  tuft of feathers over the beak, by a crest on the head, by a most
  peculiar coo quite unlike that of any other breed, and by much-feathered
  feet. I have crossed both sexes with turbits of two sub-breeds, with
  almond tumblers, spots, and runts, and reared many mongrels and recrossed
  them; and though the crest on the head and feathered feet were inherited
  (as is generally the case with most breeds), I have never seen a vestige
  of the tuft over the beak or heard the peculiar coo. Boitard and Corbié<a
  name="NtA_145" href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> assert that this is
  the invariable result of crossing trumpeters with any other breed:
  Neumeister,<a name="NtA_146" href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> however,
  states that in Germany mongrels have been obtained, though very rarely,
  which were furnished with the tuft and would trumpet: but a pair of these
  mongrels with a tuft, which I imported, never trumpeted. Mr. Brent
  states<a name="NtA_147" href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> that the
  crossed offspring of a trumpeter were crossed <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span>with trumpeters for three
  generations, by which time the mongrels had 7-8ths of this blood in their
  veins, yet the tuft over the beak did not appear. At the fourth
  generation the tuft appeared, but the birds, though now having 15-16ths
  trumpeter's blood, still did not trumpet. This case well shows the wide
  difference between inheritance and prepotency; for here we have a
  well-established old race which transmits it characters faithfully, but
  which, when crossed with any other race, has the feeblest power of
  transmitting its two chief characteristic qualities.</p>

  <p>I will give one other instance with fowls and pigeons of weakness and
  strength in the transmission of the same character to their crossed
  offspring. The Silk-fowl breeds true, and there is reason to believe is a
  very ancient race; but when I reared a large number of mongrels from a
  Silk-hen by a Spanish cock, not one exhibited even a trace of the
  so-called silkiness. Mr. Hewitt also asserts that in no instance are the
  silky feathers transmitted by this breed when crossed with any other
  variety. But three birds out of many raised by Mr. Orton from a cross
  between a silk-cock and a bantam-hen, had silky feathers.<a
  name="NtA_148" href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> So that it is certain
  that this breed very seldom has the power of transmitting its peculiar
  plumage to its crossed progeny. On the other hand, there is a silk
  sub-variety of the fantail pigeon, which has its feathers in nearly the
  same state as in the Silk-fowl: now we have already seen that fantails,
  when crossed, possess singularly weak power in transmitting their general
  qualities; but the silk sub-variety when crossed with any other
  small-sized race invariably transmits its silky feathers!<a
  name="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The law of prepotency comes into action when species are crossed, as
  with races and individuals. Gärtner has unequivocally shown<a
  name="NtA_150" href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> that this is the case
  with plants. To give one instance: when <i>Nicotiana paniculata</i> and
  <i>vincæflora</i> are crossed, the character of <i>N. paniculata</i> is
  almost completely lost in the hybrid; but if <i>N. quadrivalvis</i> be
  crossed with <i>N. vincæflora</i>, this later species, which was before
  so prepotent, now in its turn almost disappears under the power of <i>N.
  quadrivalvis</i>. It is remarkable that the prepotency of one species
  over another in transmission is quite independent, as shown by Gärtner,
  of the greater or less facility with which the one fertilises the
  other.</p>

  <p>With animals, the jackal is prepotent over the dog, as is stated by
  Flourens who made many crosses between these animals; and this was
  likewise the case with a hybrid which I once saw between a jackal and
  terrier. I cannot doubt, from the observations of Colin and others, that
  the ass is prepotent over the horse; the prepotency in this instance
  running more strongly through the male than through the female ass; so
  that the mule resembles the ass more closely than does the hinny.<a
  name="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> The <!-- Page 68
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>male pheasant,
  judging from Mr. Hewitt's descriptions,<a name="NtA_152"
  href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> and from the hybrids which I have
  seen, preponderates over the domestic fowl; but the latter, as far as
  colour is concerned, has considerable power of transmission, for hybrids
  raised from five differently coloured hens differed greatly in plumage. I
  formerly examined some curious hybrids in the Zoological Gardens, between
  the Penguin variety of the common duck and the Egyptian goose (<i>Tadorna
  Ægyptiaca</i>); and although I will not assert that the domesticated
  variety preponderated over the natural species, yet it had strongly
  impressed its unnatural upright figure on these hybrids.</p>

  <p>I am aware that such cases as the foregoing have been ascribed by
  various authors, not to one species, race, or individual being prepotent
  over the other in impressing it character on its crossed offspring, but
  to such rules as that the father influences the external characters and
  the mother the internal or vital organs. But the great diversity of the
  rules given by various authors almost proves their falseness. Dr. Prosper
  Lucas has fully discussed this point, and has shown<a name="NtA_153"
  href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> that none of the rules (and I could
  add others to those quoted by him) apply to all animals. Similar rules
  have been enounced for plants, and have been proved by Gärtner<a
  name="NtA_154" href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> to be all erroneous.
  If we confine our view to the domesticated races of a single species, or
  perhaps even to the species of the same genus, some such rules may hold
  good; for instance, it seems that in reciprocally crossing various breeds
  of fowls the male generally gives colour;<a name="NtA_155"
  href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> but conspicuous exceptions have
  passed under my own eyes. In sheep it seems that the ram usually gives
  its peculiar horns and fleece to its crossed offspring, and the bull the
  presence or absence of horns.</p>

  <p>In the following chapter on Crossing I shall have occasion to show
  that certain characters are rarely or never blended by crossing, but are
  <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page69"></a>{69}</span>transmitted in an unmodified state from
  either parent-form; I refer to this fact here because it is sometimes
  accompanied on the one side by prepotency, which thus acquires the false
  appearance of unusual strength. In the same chapter I shall show that the
  rate at which a species or breed absorbs and obliterates another by
  repeated crosses, depends in chief part on prepotency in
  transmission.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In conclusion, some of the cases above given,&mdash;for instance, that
  of the trumpeter pigeon,&mdash;prove that there is a wide difference
  between mere inheritance and prepotency. This latter power seems to us,
  in our ignorance, to act in most cases quite capriciously. The very same
  character, even though it be an abnormal or monstrous one, such as silky
  feathers, may be transmitted by different species, when crossed, either
  with prepotent force or singular feebleness. It is obvious, that a
  purely-bred form of either sex, in all cases in which prepotency does not
  run more strongly in one sex than the other, will transmit its character
  with prepotent force over a mongrelized and already variable form.<a
  name="NtA_156" href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> From several of the
  above-given cases we may conclude that mere antiquity of character does
  not by any means necessarily make it prepotent. In some cases prepotency
  apparently depends on the same character being present and visible in one
  of the two breeds which are crossed, and latent or invisible in the other
  breed; and in this case it is natural that the character which is
  potentially present in both should be prepotent. Thus, we have reason to
  believe that there is a latent tendency in all horses to be dun-coloured
  and striped; and when a horse of this kind is crossed with one of any
  other colour, it is said that the offspring are almost sure to be
  striped. Sheep have a similar latent tendency to become dark-coloured,
  and we have seen with what prepotent force a ram with a few black spots,
  when crossed with sheep of various breeds, coloured its offspring. All
  pigeons have a latent tendency to become slaty-blue, with certain
  characteristic marks, and it is known that, when a bird thus coloured is
  crossed with one of any other colour, it is most difficult afterwards to
  eradicate the blue tint. A nearly parallel case is offered by those black
  bantams which, as they grow <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span>old, develop a latent tendency to acquire
  red feathers. But there are exceptions to the rule: hornless breeds of
  cattle possess a latent capacity to reproduce horns, yet when crossed
  with horned breeds they do not invariably produce offspring bearing
  horns.</p>

  <p>We meet with analogous cases with plants. Striped flowers, though they
  can be propagated truly by seed, have a latent tendency to become
  uniformly coloured, but when once crossed by a uniformly coloured
  variety, they ever afterwards fail to produce striped seedlings.<a
  name="NtA_157" href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> Another case is in
  some respects more curious: plants bearing peloric or regular flowers
  have so strong a latent tendency to reproduce their normally irregular
  flowers, that this often occurs by buds when a plant is transplanted into
  poorer or richer soil.<a name="NtA_158"
  href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> Now I crossed the peloric snapdragon
  (<i>Antirrhinum majus</i>), described in the last chapter, with pollen of
  the common form; and the latter, reciprocally, with peloric pollen. I
  thus raised two great beds of seedlings, and not one was peloric.
  Naudin<a name="NtA_159" href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> obtained the
  same result from crossing a peloric Linaria with the common form. I
  carefully examined the flowers of ninety plants of the crossed
  Antirrhinum in the two beds, and their structure had not been in the
  least affected by the cross, except that in a few instances the minute
  rudiment of the fifth stamen, which is always present, was more fully or
  even completely developed. It must not be supposed that this entire
  obliteration of the peloric structure in the crossed plants can be
  accounted for by any incapacity of transmission; for I raised a large bed
  of plants from the peloric Antirrhinum, artificially fertilised by its
  own pollen, and sixteen plants, which alone survived the winter, were all
  as perfectly peloric as the parent-plant. Here we have a good instance of
  the wide difference between the inheritance of a character and the power
  of transmitting it to crossed offspring. The crossed plants, which
  perfectly resembled the common snapdragon, were allowed to sow
  themselves, and, out of a hundred and twenty-seven seedlings,
  eighty-eight proved to be common snapdragons, two were in an intermediate
  condition between the peloric and normal state, <!-- Page 71 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>{71}</span>and thirty-seven were
  perfectly peloric, having reverted to the structure of their one
  grandparent. This case seems at first sight to offer an exception to the
  rule formerly given, namely, that a character which is present in one
  form and latent in the other is generally transmitted with prepotent
  force when the two forms are crossed. For in all the Scrophulariaceæ, and
  especially in the genera Antirrhinum and Linaria, there is, as was shown
  in the last chapter, a strong latent tendency to become peloric; and
  there is also, as we have just seen, a still stronger tendency in all
  peloric plants to reacquire their normal irregular structure. So that we
  have two opposed latent tendencies in the same plants. Now, with the
  crossed Antirrhinums the tendency to produce normal or irregular flowers,
  like those of the common Snapdragon, prevailed in the first generation;
  whilst the tendency to pelorism, appearing to gain strength by the
  intermission of a generation, prevailed to a large extent in the second
  set of seedlings. How it is possible for a character to gain strength by
  the intermission of a generation, will be considered in the chapter on
  pangenesis.</p>

  <p>On the whole, the subject of prepotency is extremely
  intricate,&mdash;from its varying so much in strength, even in regard to
  the same character, in different animals,&mdash;from its running either
  equally in both sexes, or, as frequently is the case with animals, but
  not with plants, much stronger in the one sex than the other,&mdash;from
  the existence of secondary sexual characters,&mdash;from the transmission
  of certain characters being limited, as we shall immediately see, by
  sex,&mdash;from certain characters not blending together,&mdash;and,
  perhaps, occasionally from the effects of a previous fertilisation on the
  mother. It is therefore not surprising that every one hitherto has been
  baffled in drawing up general rules on the subject of prepotency.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Inheritance as limited by Sex.</i></p>

  <p>New characters often appear in one sex, and are afterwards transmitted
  to the same sex, either exclusively or in a much greater degree than to
  the other. This subject is important, because with animals of many kinds
  in a state of nature, both high and low in the scale, secondary sexual
  characters, not in <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>{72}</span>any way directly connected with the organs
  of reproduction, are often conspicuously present. With our domesticated
  animals, also, these same secondary characters are often found to differ
  greatly from the state in which they exist in the parent-species. And the
  principle of inheritance as limited by sex shows how such characters
  might have been first acquired and subsequently modified.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Dr. P. Lucas, who has collected many facts on this subject, shows<a
  name="NtA_160" href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> that when a
  peculiarity, in no manner connected with the reproductive organs, appears
  in either parent, it is often transmitted exclusively to the offspring of
  the same sex, or to a much greater number of them than of the opposite
  sex. Thus, in the family of Lambert, the horn-like projections on the
  skin were transmitted from the father to his sons and grandsons alone; so
  it has been with other cases of ichthyosis, with supernumerary digits,
  with a deficiency of digits and phalanges, and in a lesser degree with
  various diseases, especially with colour-blindness, and a hæmorrhagic
  diathesis, that is, an extreme liability to profuse and uncontrollable
  bleeding from trifling wounds. On the other hand, mothers have
  transmitted, during several generations, to their daughters alone,
  supernumerary and deficient digits, colour-blindness, and other
  peculiarities. So that we see that the very same peculiarity may become
  attached to either sex, and be long inherited by that sex alone; but the
  attachment in certain cases is much more frequent to one than the other
  sex. The same peculiarities also may be promiscuously transmitted to
  either sex. Dr. Lucas gives other cases, showing that the male
  occasionally transmits his peculiarities to his daughters alone, and the
  mother to her sons alone; but even in this case we see that inheritance
  is to a certain extent, though inversely, regulated by sex. Dr. Lucas,
  after weighing the whole evidence, comes to the conclusion that every
  peculiarity, according to the sex in which it first appears, tends to be
  transmitted in a greater or lesser degree to that sex.</p>

  <p>A few details from the many cases collected by Mr. Sedgwick,<a
  name="NtA_161" href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> may be here given.
  Colour-blindness, from some unknown cause, shows itself much oftener in
  males than in females; in upwards of two hundred cases collected by Mr.
  Sedgwick, nine-tenths related to men; but it is eminently liable to be
  transmitted through women. In the case given by Dr. Earle, members of
  eight related families were affected during five generations: these
  families consisted of sixty-one individuals, namely, of thirty-two males,
  of whom nine-sixteenths were incapable of distinguishing colour, and of
  twenty-nine females, of whom only one-fifteenth were thus affected. <!--
  Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span>Although
  colour-blindness thus generally clings to the male sex, nevertheless, in
  one instance in which it first appeared in a female, it was transmitted
  during five generations to thirteen individuals, all of whom were
  females. A hæmorrhagic diathesis, often accompanied by rheumatism, has
  been known to affect the males alone during five generations, being
  transmitted, however, through the females. It is said that deficient
  phalanges in the fingers have been inherited by the females alone during
  ten generations. In another case, a man thus deficient in both hands and
  feet, transmitted the peculiarity to his two sons and one daughter; but
  in the third generation, out of nineteen grandchildren, twelve sons had
  the family defect, whilst the seven daughters were free. In ordinary
  cases of sexual limitation, the sons or daughters inherit the
  peculiarity, whatever it may be, from their father or mother, and
  transmit it to their children of the same sex; but generally with the
  hæmorrhagic diathesis, and often with colour-blindness, and in some other
  cases, the sons never inherit the peculiarity directly from their
  fathers, but the daughters, and the daughters alone, transmit the latent
  tendency, so that the sons of the daughters alone exhibit it. Thus, the
  father, grandson, and great-great-grandson will exhibit a
  peculiarity,&mdash;the grandmother, daughter, and great-granddaughter
  having transmitted it in a latent state. Hence we have, as Mr. Sedgwick
  remarks, a double kind of atavism or reversion; each grandson apparently
  receiving and developing the peculiarity from his grandfather, and each
  daughter apparently receiving the latent tendency from her
  grandmother.</p>

  <p>From the various facts recorded by Dr. Prosper Lucas, Mr. Sedgwick,
  and others, there can be no doubt that peculiarities first appearing in
  either sex, though not in any way necessarily or invariably connected
  with that sex, strongly tend to be inherited by the offspring of the same
  sex, but are often transmitted in a latent state through the opposite
  sex.</p>

  <p>Turning now to domesticated animals, we find that certain characters
  not proper to the parent-species are often confined to, and inherited by,
  one sex alone; but we do not know the history of the first appearance of
  such characters. In the chapter on Sheep, we have seen that the males of
  certain races differ greatly from the females in the shape of their
  horns, these being absent in the ewes of some breeds, in the development
  of fat in the tail in certain fat-tailed breeds, and in the outline of
  the forehead. These differences, judging from the character of the allied
  wild species, cannot be accounted for by supposing that they have been
  derived from distinct parent-forms. There is, also, a great difference
  between the horns of the two sexes in one Indian breed of goats. The bull
  zebu is said to have a larger hump than the cow. In the Scotch deer-hound
  the two sexes differ in size more than in any other variety of the dog,<a
  name="NtA_162" href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> and, judging from
  analogy, more than in the aboriginal parent-species. The peculiar colour
  called tortoise-shell is very rarely seen in a male cat; the males of
  this variety being of a rusty tint. A tendency to baldness in man before
  the advent of old age is certainly inherited; and in the European, or at
  least in the <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>Englishman, is an attribute of the male sex,
  and may almost be ranked as an incipient secondary sexual character.</p>

  <p>In various breeds of the fowl the males and females often differ
  greatly; and these differences are far from being the same with those
  which distinguish the two sexes in the parent-species, the <i>Gallus
  bankiva</i>; and consequently have originated under domestication. In
  certain sub-varieties of the Game race we have the unusual case of the
  hens differing from each other more than the cocks. In an Indian breed of
  a white colour stained with soot, the hens invariably have black skins,
  and their bones are covered by a black periosteum, whilst the cocks are
  never or most rarely thus characterised. Pigeons offer a more interesting
  case; for the two sexes rarely differ throughout the whole great family,
  and the males and females of the parent-form, the <i>C. livia</i>, are
  undistinguishable; yet we have seen that with Pouters the male has the
  characteristic quality of pouting more strongly developed than the
  female; and in certain sub-varieties<a name="NtA_163"
  href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> the males alone are spotted or
  striated with black. When male and female English carrier-pigeons are
  exhibited in separate pens, the difference in the development of the
  wattle over the beak and round the eyes is conspicuous. So that here we
  have instances of the appearance of secondary sexual characters in the
  domesticated races of a species in which such differences are naturally
  quite absent.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On the other hand, secondary sexual characters which properly belong
  to the species are sometimes quite lost, or greatly diminished, under
  domestication. We see this in the small size of the tusks in our improved
  breeds of the pig, in comparison with those of the wild boar. There are
  sub-breeds of fowls in which the males have lost the fine flowing
  tail-feathers and hackles; and others in which there is no difference in
  colour between the two sexes. In some cases the barred plumage, which in
  gallinaceous birds is commonly the attribute of the hen, has been
  transferred to the cock, as in the cuckoo sub-breeds. In other cases
  masculine characters have been partly transferred to the female, as with
  the splendid plumage of the golden-spangled Hamburgh hen, the enlarged
  comb of the Spanish hen, the pugnacious disposition of the Game hen, and
  as in the well-developed spurs which occasionally appear in the hens of
  various breeds. In Polish fowls both sexes are ornamented with a topknot,
  that of the male being formed of hackle-like feathers, and this is a new
  male character in the genus Gallus. On the whole, as far as I can judge,
  new characters are more apt <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>{75}</span>to appear in the males of our domesticated
  animals than in the females, and afterwards to be either exclusively or
  more strongly inherited by the males. Finally, in accordance with the
  principle of inheritance as limited by sex, the appearance of secondary
  sexual characters in natural species offers no especial difficulty, and
  their subsequent increase and modification, if of any service to the
  species, would follow through that form of selection which in my 'Origin
  of Species' I have called sexual selection.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Inheritance at corresponding periods of Life.</i></p>

  <p>This is an important subject. Since the publication of my 'Origin of
  Species,' I have seen no reason to doubt the truth of the explanation
  there given of perhaps the most remarkable of all the facts in biology,
  namely, the difference between the embryo and the adult animal. The
  explanation is, that variations do not necessarily or generally occur at
  a very early period of embryonic growth, and that such variations are
  inherited at a corresponding age. As a consequence of this the embryo,
  even when the parent-form undergoes a great amount of modification, is
  left only slightly modified; and the embryos of widely-different animals
  which are descended from a common progenitor remain in many important
  respects like each other and their common progenitor. We can thus
  understand why embryology should throw a flood of light on the natural
  system of classification, for this ought to be as far as possible
  genealogical. When the embryo leads an independent life, that is, becomes
  a larva, it has to be adapted to the surrounding conditions in its
  structure and instincts, independently of those of its parents; and the
  principle of inheritance at corresponding periods of life renders this
  possible.</p>

  <p>This principle is, indeed, in one way so obvious that it escapes
  attention. We possess a number of races of animals and plants, which,
  when compared with each other and with their parent-forms, present
  conspicuous differences, both in the immature and mature states. Look at
  the seeds of the several kinds of peas, beans, maize, which can be
  propagated truly, and see how they differ in size, colour, and shape,
  whilst the <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page76"></a>{76}</span>full-grown plants differ but little.
  Cabbages on the other hand differ greatly in foliage and manner of
  growth, but hardly at all in their seeds; and generally it will be found
  that the differences between cultivated plants at different periods of
  growth are not necessarily closely connected together, for plants may
  differ much in their seeds and little when full-grown, and conversely may
  yield seeds hardly distinguishable, yet differ much when full-grown. In
  the several breeds of poultry, descended from a single species,
  differences in the eggs and chickens, in the plumage at the first and
  subsequent moults, in the comb and wattles during maturity, are all
  inherited. With man peculiarities in the milk and second teeth, of which
  I have received the details, are inheritable, and with man longevity is
  often transmitted. So again with our improved breeds of cattle and sheep,
  early maturity, including the early development of the teeth, and with
  certain breeds of fowl the early appearance of secondary sexual
  characters, all come under the same head of inheritance at corresponding
  periods.</p>

  <p>Numerous analogous facts could be given. The silk-moth, perhaps,
  offers the best instance; for in the breeds which transmit their
  characters truly, the eggs differ in size, colour, and shape;&mdash;the
  caterpillars differ, in moulting three or four times, in colour, even in
  having a dark-coloured mark like an eyebrow, and in the loss of certain
  instincts;&mdash;the cocoons differ in size, shape, and in the colour and
  quality of the silk; these several differences being followed by slight
  or barely distinguishable differences in the mature moth.</p>

  <p>But it may be said that, if in the above cases a new peculiarity is
  inherited, it must be at the corresponding stage of development; for an
  egg or seed can resemble only an egg or seed, and the horn in a
  full-grown ox can resemble only a horn. The following cases show
  inheritance at corresponding periods more plainly, because they refer to
  peculiarities which might have supervened, as far as we can see, earlier
  or later in life, yet are inherited at the same period at which they
  first appeared.</p>

  neck, and head; but before the first moult all the white feathers acquire
  coloured edges. Another breed is more remarkable: its first plumage is
  black, with rusty-red wing-bars and a crescent-shaped mark on the breast;

  only retained until the first moult, so that they must be exhibited ere
  the change takes place. Once moulted, the peculiarity has ceased. Of
  course all the birds emanating from this stock have black wings and tails
  the first year."<a name="NtA_167" href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> A
  curious and somewhat analogous account has been given<a name="NtA_168"
  href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> of a family of wild pied rooks which
  were first observed in 1798, near Chalfont, and which every year from
  that date up to the period of the published notice, viz. 1837, "have
  several of their brood particoloured, black and white. This variegation
  of the plumage, however, disappears with the first moult; but among the
  next young families there are always a few pied ones." These changes of
  plumage, which appear and are inherited at various corresponding periods
  of life in the pigeon, canary-bird, and rook, are remarkable, because the
  parent-species undergo no such change.</p>

  <p>Inherited diseases afford evidence in some respects of less value than
  the foregoing cases, because diseases are not necessarily connected with
  any change in structure; but in other respects of more value, because the
  periods have been more carefully observed. Certain diseases are
  communicated to the child apparently by a process like inoculation, and
  the child is from the first affected; such cases may be here passed over.
  Large classes of diseases usually appear at certain ages, such as St.
  Vitus's dance in youth, consumption in early mid-life, gout later, and
  apoplexy still later; and these are naturally inherited at the same
  period. But even in diseases of this class, instances have been recorded,
  as with St. Vitus's <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page78"></a>{78}</span>dance, showing that an unusually early or
  late tendency to the disease is inheritable.<a name="NtA_169"
  href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> In most cases the appearance of any
  inherited disease is largely determined by certain critical periods in
  each person's life, as well as by unfavourable conditions. There are many
  other diseases, which are not attached to any <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `particuliar'.">particular</span> period, but which
  certainly tend to appear in the child at about the same age at which the
  parent was first attacked. An array of high authorities, ancient and
  modern, could be given in support of this proposition. The illustrious
  Hunter believed in it; and Piorry<a name="NtA_170"
  href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> cautions the physician to look
  closely to the child at the period when any grave inheritable disease
  attacked the parent. Dr. Prosper Lucas,<a name="NtA_171"
  href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> after collecting facts from every
  source, asserts that affections of all kinds, though not related to any
  particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at whatever
  period of life they first appeared in the progenitor.</p>

  <p>As the subject is important, it may be well to give a few instances,
  simply as illustrations, not as proof; for proof, recourse must be had to
  the authorities above quoted. Some of the following cases have been
  selected for the sake of showing that, when a slight departure from the
  rule occurs, the child is affected somewhat earlier in life than the
  parent. In the family of Le Compte blindness was inherited during three
  generations, and no less than thirty-seven children and grandchildren
  were all affected at about the same age, namely seventeen or eighteen.<a
  name="NtA_172" href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> In another case a
  father and his four children all became blind at twenty-one years old; in
  another, a grandmother grew blind at thirty-five, her daughter at
  nineteen, and three grandchildren at the ages of thirteen and eleven.<a
  name="NtA_173" href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> So with deafness, two
  brothers, their father and paternal grandfather, all became deaf at the
  age of forty.<a name="NtA_174" href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Esquirol gives several striking instances of insanity coming on at the
  same age, as that of a grandfather, father, and son, who all committed
  suicide near their fiftieth year. Many other cases could be given, as of
  a whole family who became insane at the age of forty.<a name="NtA_175"
  href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> Other cerebral affections sometimes
  follow the same rule,&mdash;for instance, epilepsy and apoplexy. A woman
  died of the latter disease when sixty-three years old; one of her
  daughters at forty-three, and the other at sixty-seven: the latter had
  twelve children, who all died from tubercular meningitis.<a
  name="NtA_176" href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> I mention this latter
  case because it illustrates a frequent occurrence, namely, a change in
  the precise nature of an inherited disease, though still affecting the
  same organ.</p>

<p><!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>{79}</span></p>

  <p>Asthma has attacked several members of the same family when forty
  years old, and other families during infancy. The most different
  diseases, as angina pectoris, stone in the bladder, and various
  affections of the skin, have appeared in successive generations at nearly
  the same age. The little finger of a man began from some unknown cause to
  grow inwards, and the same finger in his two sons began at the same age
  to bend inwards in a similar manner. Strange and inexplicable neuralgic
  affections have caused parents and children to suffer agonies at about
  the same period of life.<a name="NtA_177"
  href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I will give only two other cases, which are interesting as
  illustrating the disappearance as well as the appearance of disease at
  the same age. Two brothers, their father, their paternal uncles, seven
  cousins, and their paternal grandfather, were all similarly affected by a
  skin-disease, called pityriasis versicolor; "the disease, strictly
  limited to the males of the family (though transmitted through the
  females), usually appeared at puberty, and disappeared at about the age
  of forty or forty-five years." The second case is that of four brothers,
  who when about twelve years old suffered almost every week from severe
  headaches, which were relieved only by a recumbent position in a dark
  room. Their father, paternal uncles, paternal grandfather, and paternal
  granduncles all suffered in the same way from headaches, which ceased at
  the age of fifty-four or fifty-five in all those who lived so long. None
  of the females of the family were affected.<a name="NtA_178"
  href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is impossible to read the foregoing accounts, and the many others
  which have been recorded, of diseases coming on during three or even more
  generations, at the same age in several members of the same family,
  especially in the case of rare affections in which the coincidence cannot
  be attributed to chance, and doubt that there is a strong tendency to
  inheritance in disease at corresponding periods of life. When the rule
  fails, the disease is apt to come on earlier in the child than in the
  parent; the exceptions in the other direction being vey much rarer. Dr.
  Lucas<a name="NtA_179" href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> alludes to
  several cases of inherited diseases coming on at an earlier period. I
  have already given one striking instance with blindness during three
  generations; and Mr. Bowman remarks that this frequently occurs with
  cataract. With cancer there seems to be a peculiar liability to earlier
  inheritance: Mr. Paget, who has particularly <!-- Page 80 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span>attended to this subject,
  and tabulated a large number of cases, informs me that he believes that
  in nine cases out of ten the later generation suffers from the disease at
  an earlier period than the previous generation. He adds, "In the
  instances in which the opposite relation holds, and the members of later
  generations have cancer at a later age than their predecessors, I think
  it will be found that the non-cancerous parents have lived to extreme old
  ages." So that the longevity of a non-affected parent seems to have the
  power of determining in the offspring the fatal period; and we thus
  apparently get another element of complexity in inheritance.</p>

  <p>The facts, showing that with certain diseases the period of
  inheritance occasionally or even frequently advances, are important with
  respect to the general descent-theory, for they render it in some degree
  probable that the same thing would occur with ordinary modifications of
  structure. The final result of a long series of such advances would be
  the gradual obliteration of characters proper to the embryo and larva,
  which would thus come to resemble more and more closely the mature
  parent-form. But any structure which was of service to the embryo or
  larva would be preserved by the destruction at this stage of growth of
  each individual which manifested any tendency to lose at too early an age
  its own proper character.</p>

  <p>Finally, from the numerous races of cultivated plants and domestic
  animals, in which the seed or eggs, the young or old, differ from each
  other and from their parent-species;&mdash;from the cases in which new
  characters have appeared at a particular period, and afterwards have been
  inherited at the same period;&mdash;and from what we know with respect to
  disease, we must believe in the truth of the great principle of
  inheritance at corresponding periods of life.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Summary of the three preceding Chapters.</i>&mdash;Strong as is the
  force of inheritance, it allows the incessant appearance of new
  characters. These, whether beneficial or injurious, of the most trifling
  importance, such as a shade of colour in a flower, a coloured lock of
  hair, or a mere gesture; or of the highest importance, as when affecting
  the brain or an organ so perfect <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span>and complex as the eye; or of so grave a
  nature as to deserve to be called a monstrosity, or so peculiar as not to
  occur normally in any member of the same natural class, are all sometimes
  strongly inherited by man, the lower animals, and plants. In numberless
  cases it suffices for the inheritance of a peculiarity that one parent
  alone should be thus characterised. Inequalities in the two sides of the
  body, though opposed to the law of symmetry, may be transmitted. There is
  a considerable body of evidence showing that even mutilations, and the
  effects of accidents, especially or perhaps exclusively when followed by
  disease, are occasionally inherited. There can be no doubt that the evil
  effects of long-continued exposure in the parent to injurious conditions
  are sometimes transmitted to the offspring. So it is, as we shall see in
  a future chapter, with the effects of the use and disuse of parts, and of
  mental habits. Periodical habits are likewise transmitted, but generally,
  as it would appear, with little force.</p>

  <p>Hence we are led to look at inheritance as the rule, and
  non-inheritance as the anomaly. But this power often appears to us in our
  ignorance to act capriciously, transmitting a character with inexplicable
  strength or feebleness. The very same peculiarity, as the weeping habit
  of trees, silky-feathers, &amp;c., may be inherited either firmly or not
  at all by different members of the same group, and even by different
  individuals of the same species, though treated in the same manner. In
  this latter case we see that the power of transmission is a quality which
  is merely individual in its attachment. As with single characters, so it
  is with the several concurrent slight differences which distinguish
  sub-varieties or races; for of these, some can be propagated almost as
  truly as species, whilst others cannot be relied on. The same rule holds
  good with plants, when propagated by bulbs, offsets, &amp;c., which in
  one sense still form parts of the same individual, for some varieties
  retain or inherit through successive bud-generations their character far
  more truly than others.</p>

  <p>Some characters not proper to the parent-species have certainly been
  inherited from an extremely remote epoch, and may therefore be considered
  as firmly fixed. But it is doubtful whether length of inheritance in
  itself gives fixedness of character; <!-- Page 82 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>{82}</span>though the chances are
  obviously in favour of any character which has long been transmitted true
  or unaltered, still being transmitted true as long as the conditions of
  life remain the same. We know that many species, after having retained
  the same character for countless ages, whilst living under their natural
  conditions, when domesticated have varied in the most diversified manner,
  that is, have failed to transmit their original form; so that no
  character appears to be absolutely fixed. We can sometimes account for
  the failure of inheritance by the conditions of life being opposed to the
  development of certain characters; and still oftener, as with plants
  cultivated by grafts and buds, by the conditions causing new and slight
  modifications incessantly to appear. In this latter case it is not that
  inheritance wholly fails, but that new characters are continually
  superadded. In some few cases, in which both parents are similarly
  characterised, inheritance seems to gain so much force by the combined
  action of the two parents, that it counteracts its own power, and a new
  modification is the result.</p>

  <p>In many cases the failure of the parents to transmit their likeness is
  due to the breed having been at some former period crossed; and the child
  takes after his grandparent or more remote ancestor of foreign blood. In
  other cases, in which the breed has not been crossed, but some ancient
  character has been lost through variation, it occasionally reappears
  through reversion, so that the parents apparently fail to transmit their
  own likeness. In all cases, however, we may safely conclude that the
  child inherits all its characters from its parents, in whom certain
  characters are latent, like the secondary sexual characters of one sex in
  the other. When, after a long succession of bud-generations, a flower or
  fruit becomes separated into distinct segments, having the colours or
  other attributes of both parent-forms, we cannot doubt that these
  characters were latent in the earlier buds, though they could not then be
  detected, or could be detected only in an intimately commingled state. So
  it is with animals of crossed parentage, which with advancing years
  occasionally exhibit characters derived from one of their two parents, of
  which not a trace could at first be perceived. Certain monstrosities,
  which resemble what naturalists call the typical form of the group in
  question, <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>{83}</span>apparently come under the same law of
  reversion. It is assuredly an astonishing fact that the male and female
  sexual elements, that buds, and even full-grown animals, should retain
  characters, during several generations in the case of crossed breeds, and
  during thousands of generations in the case of pure breeds, written as it
  were in invisible ink, yet ready at any time to be evolved under the
  requisite conditions.</p>

  <p>What these conditions are, we do not in many cases at all know. But
  the act of crossing in itself, apparently from causing some disturbance
  in the organisation, certainly gives a strong tendency to the
  reappearance of long-lost characters, both corporeal and mental,
  independently of those derived from the cross. A return of any species to
  its natural conditions of life, as with feral animals and plants, favours
  reversion; though it is certain that this tendency exists, we do not know
  how far it prevails, and it has been much exaggerated. On the other hand,
  the crossed offspring of plants which have had their organisation
  disturbed by cultivation, are more liable to reversion than the crossed
  offspring of species which have always lived under their natural
  conditions.</p>

  <p>When distinguishable individuals of the same family, or races, or
  species are crossed, we see that the one is often prepotent over the
  other in transmitting its own character. A race may possess a strong
  power of inheritance, and yet when crossed, as we have seen with
  trumpeter-pigeons, yield to the prepotency of every other race.
  Prepotentcy of transmission may be equal in the two sexes of the same
  species, but often runs more strongly in one sex. It plays an important
  part in determining the rate at which one race can be modified or wholly
  absorbed by repeated crosses with another. We can seldom tell what makes
  one race or species prepotent over another; but it sometimes depends on
  the same character being present and visible in one parent, and latent or
  potentially present in the other.</p>

  <p>Characters may first appear in either sex, but oftener in the male
  than in the female, and afterwards be transmitted to the offspring of the
  same sex. In this case we may feel confident that the peculiarity in
  question is really present though latent in the opposite sex; hence the
  father may transmit through his daughter any character to his grandson;
  and the mother <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span>conversely to her granddaughter. We thus
  learn, and the fact is an important one, that transmission and
  development are distinct powers. Occasionally these two powers seem to be
  antagonistic, or incapable of combination in the same individual; for
  several cases have been recorded in which the son has not directly
  inherited a character from his father, or directly transmitted it to his
  son, but has received it by transmission through his non-affected mother,
  and transmitted it through his non-affected daughter. Owing to
  inheritance being limited by sex, we can see how secondary sexual
  characters may first have arisen under nature; their preservation and
  accumulation being dependent on their service to either sex.</p>

  <p>At whatever period of life a new character first appears, it generally
  remains latent in the offspring until a corresponding age is attained,
  and then it is developed. When this rule fails, the child generally
  exhibits the character at an earlier period than the parent. On this
  principle of inheritance at corresponding periods, we can understand how
  it is that most animals display from the germ to maturity such a
  marvellous succession of characters.</p>

  <p>Finally, though much remains obscure with respect to Inheritance, we
  may look at the following laws as fairly well established. Firstly, a
  tendency in every character, new and old, to be transmitted by seminal
  and bud generation, though often counteracted by various known and
  unknown causes. Secondly, reversion or atavism, which depends on
  transmission and development being distinct powers: it acts in various
  degrees and manners through both seminal and bud generation. Thirdly,
  prepotency of transmission, which may be confined to one sex, or be
  common to both sexes of the prepotent form. Fourthly, transmission,
  limited by sex, generally to the same sex in which the inherited
  character first appeared. Fifthly, inheritance at corresponding periods
  of life, with some tendency to the earlier development of the inherited
  character. In these laws of Inheritance, as displayed under
  domestication, we see an ample provision for the production, through
  variability and natural selection, of new specific forms.</p>

  FORMATION OF DOMESTIC RACES.</span></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the two previous chapters, when discussing reversion and
  prepotency, I was necessarily led to give many facts on crossing. In the
  present chapter I shall consider the part which crossing plays in two
  opposed directions,&mdash;firstly, in obliterating characters, and
  consequently in preventing the formation of new races; and secondly, in
  the modification of old races, or in the formation of new and
  intermediate races, by a combination of characters. I shall also show
  that certain characters are incapable of fusion.</p>

  <p>The effects of free or uncontrolled breeding between the members of
  the same variety or of closely allied varieties are important; but are so
  obvious that they need not be discussed at much length. It is free
  intercrossing which chiefly gives uniformity, both under nature and under
  domestication, to the individuals of the same species or variety, when
  they live mingled together and are not exposed to any cause inducing
  excessive variability. The prevention of free crossing, and the
  intentional matching of individual animals, are the corner-stones of the
  breeder's art. No man in his senses would expect to improve or modify a
  breed in any particular manner, or keep an old breed true and distinct,
  unless he separated his animals. The killing of inferior animals in each
  generation comes to the <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span>same thing as their separation. In savage
  and semi-civilised countries, where the inhabitants have not the means of
  separating their animals, more than a single breed of the same species
  rarely or never exists. In former times, even in a country so civilised
  as North America, there were no distinct races of sheep, for all had been
  mingled together.<a name="NtA_180" href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a>
  The celebrated agriculturist Marshall<a name="NtA_181"
  href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> remarks that "sheep that are kept
  within fences, as well as shepherded flocks in open countries, have
  generally a similarity, if not a uniformity, of character in the
  individuals of each flock;" for they breed freely together, and are
  prevented from crossing with other kinds; whereas in the unenclosed parts
  of England the unshepherded sheep, even of the same flock, are far from
  true or uniform, owing to various breeds having mingled and crossed. We
  have seen that the half-wild cattle in the several British parks are
  uniform in character in each; but in the different parks, from not having
  mingled and crossed during many generations, they differ in a slight
  degree.</p>

  <p>We cannot doubt that the extraordinary number of varieties and
  sub-varieties of the pigeon, amounting to at least one hundred and fifty,
  is partly due to their remaining, differently from other domesticated
  birds, paired for life when once matched. On the other hand, breeds of
  cats imported into this country soon disappear, for their nocturnal and
  rambling habits render it hardly possible to prevent free crossing.
  Rengger<a name="NtA_182" href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> gives an
  interesting case with respect to the cat in Paraguay: in all the distant
  parts of the kingdom it has assumed, apparently from the effects of the
  climate, a peculiar character, but near the capital this change has been
  prevented, owing, as he asserts, to the native animal frequently crossing
  with cats imported from Europe. In all cases like the foregoing, the
  effects of an occasional cross will be augmented by the increased vigour
  and fertility of the crossed offspring, of which fact evidence will
  hereafter be given; for this will lead to the mongrels increasing more
  rapidly than the pure parent-breeds.</p>

<p><!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span></p>

  <p>When distinct breeds are allowed to cross freely, the result will be a
  heterogenous body; for instance, the dogs in Paraguay are far from
  uniform, and can no longer be affiliated to their parent-races.<a
  name="NtA_183" href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> The character which a
  crossed body of animals will ultimately assume must depend on several
  contingencies,&mdash;namely, on the relative numbers of the individuals
  belonging to the two or more races which are allowed to mingle; on the
  prepotency of one race over the other in the transmission of character;
  and on the conditions of life to which they are exposed. When two
  commingled breeds exist at first in nearly equal numbers, the whole will
  sooner or later become intimately blended, but not so soon, both breeds
  being equally favoured in all respects, as might have been expected. The
  following calculation<a name="NtA_184"
  href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> shows that this is the case: if a
  colony with an equal number of black and white men were founded, and we
  assume that they marry indiscriminately, are equally prolific, and that
  one in thirty annually dies and is born; then "in 65 years the number of
  blacks, whites, and mulattoes would be equal. In 91 years the whites
  would be 1-10th, the blacks 1-10th, and the mulattoes, or people of
  intermediate degrees of colour, 8-10ths of the whole number. In three
  centuries not 1-100th part of the whites would exist."</p>

  <p>When one of two mingled races exceeds the other greatly in number, the
  latter will soon be wholly, or almost wholly, absorbed and lost.<a
  name="NtA_185" href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> Thus European pigs and
  dogs have been largely introduced into the islands of the Pacific Ocean,
  and the native races have been absorbed and lost in the course of about
  fifty or sixty years;<a name="NtA_186"
  href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> but the imported races no doubt were
  favoured. Rats may be considered as semi-domesticated animals. Some
  snake-rats (<i>Mus alexandrinus</i>) escaped in the Zoological Gardens of
  London, "and for a long time afterwards the keepers frequently caught
  cross-bred rats, at first half-breds, afterwards with less and less of
  the character of the snake-rat, till at length all traces of it
  disappeared."<a name="NtA_187" href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> On the
  other hand, <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span>in some parts of London, especially near the
  docks, where fresh rats are frequently imported, an endless variety of
  intermediate forms may be found between the brown, black, and snake rat,
  which are all three usually ranked as distinct species.</p>

  <p>How many generations are necessary for one species or race to absorb
  another by repeated crosses has often been discussed;<a name="NtA_188"
  href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> and the requisite number has probably
  been much exaggerated. Some writers have maintained that a dozen, or
  score, or even more generations, are necessary; but this in itself is
  improbable, for in the tenth generation there will be only 1-1024th part
  of foreign blood in the offspring. Gärtner found,<a name="NtA_189"
  href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> that with plants one species could be
  made to absorb another in from three to five generations, and he believes
  that this could always be effected in from six to seventh generations. In
  one instance, however, Kölreuter<a name="NtA_190"
  href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> speaks of the offspring of
  <i>Mirabilis vulgaris</i>, crossed during eight successive generations by
  <i>M. longiflora</i>, as resembling this latter species so closely, that
  the most scrupulous observer could detect "vix aliquam notabilem
  differentiam;"&mdash;he succeeded, as he says, "ad plenariam fere
  transmutationem." But this expression shows that the act of absorption
  was not even then absolutely complete, though these crossed plants
  contained only the 1-256th part of <i>M. vulgaris</i>. The conclusions of
  such accurate observers as Gärtner and Kölreuter are of far higher worth
  than those made without scientific aim by breeders. The most remarkable
  statement which I have met with of the persistent endurance of the
  effects of a single cross is given by Fleischmann,<a name="NtA_191"
  href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> who, in reference to German sheep,
  says "that the original coarse sheep have 5500 fibres of wool on a square
  inch; grades of the third or fourth Merino cross produced about 8000, the
  twentieth cross 27,000, the perfect pure Merino blood 40,000 to 48,000."
  So that in this case common German sheep crossed twenty times
  successively with Merinos have not by any means acquired wool as fine as
  that of the pure breed. In all cases, the rate of absorption will <!--
  Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span>depend
  largely on the conditions of life being favourable to any particular
  character; and we may suspect that there would be under the climate of
  Germany a constant tendency to degeneration in the wool of Merinos,
  unless prevented by careful selection; and thus perhaps the foregoing
  remarkable case may be explained. The rate of absorption must also depend
  on the amount of distinguishable difference between the two forms which
  are crossed, and especially, as Gärtner insists, on prepotency of
  transmission in the one form over the other. We have seen in the last
  chapter that one of two French breeds of sheep yielded up its character,
  when crossed with Merinos, very much slower than the other; and the
  common German sheep referred to by Fleischmann may present an analogous
  case. But in all cases there will be during many subsequent generations
  more or less liability to reversion, and it is this fact which has
  probably led authors to maintain that a score or more of generations are
  requisite for one race to absorb another. In considering the final result
  of the commingling of two or more breeds, we must not forget that the act
  of crossing in itself tends to bring back long-lost characters not proper
  to the immediate parent-forms.</p>

  <p>With respect to the influence of the conditions of life on any two
  breeds which are allowed to cross freely, unless both are indigenous and
  have long been accustomed to the country where they live, they will, in
  all probability, be unequally affected by the conditions, and this will
  modify the result. Even with indigenous breeds, it will rarely or never
  occur that both are equally well adapted to the surrounding
  circumstances; more especially when permitted to roam freely, and not
  carefully tended, as will generally be the case with breeds allowed to
  cross. As a consequence of this, natural selection will to a certain
  extent come into action, and the best fitted will survive, and this will
  aid in determining the ultimate character of the commingled body.</p>

  <p>How long a time it would require before such a crossed body of animals
  would assume within a limited area a uniform character no one can say;
  that they would ultimately become uniform from free intercrossing, and
  from the survival of the fittest, we may feel assured; but the character
  thus acquired would rarely or never, as we may infer from the several
  previous <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>considerations, be exactly intermediate
  between that of the two parent-breeds. With respect to the very slight
  differences by which the individuals of the same sub-variety, or even of
  allied varieties, are characterised, it is obvious that free crossing
  would soon obliterate such small distinctions. The formation of new
  varieties, independently of selection, would also thus be prevented;
  except when the same variation continually recurred from the action of
  some strongly predisposing cause. Hence we may conclude that free
  crossing has in all cases played an important part in giving to all the
  members of the same domestic race, and of the same natural species,
  uniformity of character, though largely modified by natural selection and
  by the direct action of the surrounding conditions.</p>

  <p><i>On the possibility of all organic beings occasionally
  intercrossing.</i>&mdash;But it may be asked, can free crossing occur
  with hermaphrodite animals and plants? All the higher animals, and the
  few insects which have been domesticated, have separated sexes, and must
  inevitably unite for each birth. With respect to the crossing of
  hermaphrodites, the subject is too large for the present volume, and will
  be more properly treated in a succeeding work. In my 'Origin of Species,'
  however, I have given a short abstract of the reasons which induce me to
  believe that all organic beings occasionally cross, though perhaps in
  some cases only at long intervals of time.<a name="NtA_192"
  href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> I will here just recall the fact that
  many plants, though hermaphrodite in structure, are unisexual in
  function;&mdash;such as those called by C.&nbsp;K. Sprengel
  <i>dichogamous</i>, in which the pollen and stigma of the same flower are
  matured at different periods; or those called by me <i>reciprocally
  dimorphic</i>, in which the flower's own pollen is not fitted to
  fertilise its own stigma; or again, the many kinds in which curious
  mechanical contrivances exist, effectually preventing self-fertilisation.
  There are, however, many hermaphrodite plants which are not in any way
  specially constructed to favour intercrossing, but which nevertheless
  commingle almost as freely as animals with separated sexes. This is the
  case with cabbages, radishes, and onions, as I know from <!-- Page 91
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span>having
  experimented on them: even the peasants of Liguria say that cabbages must
  be prevented "from falling in love" with each other. In the orange tribe,
  Gallesio<a name="NtA_193" href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> remarks
  that the amelioration of the various kinds is checked by their continual
  and almost regular crossing. So it is with numerous other plants.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless some cultivated plants can be named which rarely
  intercross, as the common pea, or which never intercross, as I have
  reason to believe is the case with the sweet-pea (<i>Lathyrus
  odoratus</i>); yet the structure of these flowers certainly favours an
  occasional cross. The varieties of the tomato and aubergine
  (<i>Solanum</i>) and pimenta (<i>Pimenta vulgaris?</i>) are said<a
  name="NtA_194" href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> never to cross, even
  when growing alongside each other. But it should be observed that these
  are all exotic plants, and we do not know how they would behave in their
  native country when visited by the proper insects.</p>

  <p>It must also be admitted that some few natural species appear under
  our present state of knowledge to be perpetually self-fertilised, as in
  the case of the Bee Ophrys (<i>O. apifera</i>), though adapted in its
  structure to be occasionally crossed. The <i>Leersia oryzoides</i>
  produces minute enclosed flowers which cannot possibly be crossed, and
  these alone, to the exclusion of the ordinary flowers, have as yet been
  known to yield seed.<a name="NtA_195" href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a>
  A few additional and analogous cases could be advanced. But these facts
  do not make me doubt that it is a general law of nature that the
  individuals of the same species occasionally intercross, and that some
  great advantage is derived from this act. It is well known (and I shall
  hereafter have to give instances) that some plants, both indigenous and
  naturalised, rarely or never produce flowers; or, if they flower, never
  produce seeds. But no one is thus led to doubt that it is a general law
  of nature that phanerogamic plants should produce flowers, and that these
  flowers should produce seed. When they fail, we believe that such plants
  would perform their proper functions under different conditions, or that
  they formerly did so and will do so again. On analogous grounds, I
  believe that the few flowers <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page92"></a>{92}</span>which do not now intercross, either would do
  so under different conditions, or that they formerly fertilised each
  other at intervals&mdash;the means for effecting this being generally
  still retained&mdash;and they will do so again at some future period,
  unless indeed they become extinct. On this view alone, many points in the
  structure and action of the reproductive organs in hermaphrodite plants
  and animals are intelligible,&mdash;for instance, the male and female
  organs never being so completely enclosed as to render access from
  without impossible. Hence we may conclude that the most important of all
  the means for giving uniformity to the individuals of the same species,
  namely, the capacity of occasionally intercrossing, is present, or has
  been formerly present, with all organic beings.</p>

  <p><i>On certain Characters not blending.</i>&mdash;When two breeds are
  crossed their characters usually become intimately fused together; but
  some characters refuse to blend, and are transmitted in an unmodified
  state either from both parents or from one. When grey and white mice are
  paired, the young are not piebald nor of an intermediate tint, but are
  pure white or of the ordinary grey colour: so it is when white and common
  collared turtle-doves are paired. In breeding Game fowls, a great
  authority, Mr. J. Douglas, remarks, "I may here state a strange fact: if
  you cross a black with a white game, you get birds of both breeds of the
  clearest colour." Sir R. Heron crossed during many years white, black,
  brown, and fawn-coloured Angora rabbits, and never once got these colours
  mingled in the same animal, but often all four colours in the same
  litter.<a name="NtA_196" href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> Additional
  cases could be given, but this form of inheritance is very far from
  universal even with respect to the most distinct colours. When turnspit
  dogs and ancon sheep, both of which have dwarfed limbs, are crossed with
  common breeds, the offspring are not intermediate in structure, but take
  after either parent. When tailless or hornless animals are crossed with
  perfect animals, it frequently, but by no means invariably, happens that
  the offspring are <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page93"></a>{93}</span>either perfectly furnished with these organs
  or are quite destitute of them. According to Rengger, the hairless
  condition of the Paraguay dog is either perfectly or not at all
  transmitted to its mongrel offspring; but I have seen one partial
  exception in a dog of this parentage which had part of its skin hairy,
  and part naked; the parts being distinctly separated as in a piebald
  animal. When Dorking fowls with five toes are crossed with other breeds,
  the chickens often have five toes on one foot and four on the other. Some
  crossed pigs raised by Sir R. Heron between the solid-hoofed and common
  pig had not all four feet in an intermediate condition, but two feet were
  furnished with properly divided, and two with united hoofs.</p>

  <p>Analogous facts have been observed with plants: Major Trevor Clarke
  crossed the little, glabrous-leaved, annual stock (<i>Matthiola</i>),
  with pollen of a large, red-flowered, rough-leaved, biennial stock,
  called <i>cocardeau</i> by the French, and the result was that half the
  seedlings had glabrous and the other half rough leaves, but none had
  leaves in an intermediate state. That the glabrous seedlings were the
  product of the rough-leaved variety, and not accidentally of the
  mother-plant's own pollen, was shown by their tall and strong habit of
  growth.<a name="NtA_197" href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> In the
  succeeding generations raised from the rough-leaved crossed seedlings,
  some glabrous plants appeared, showing that the glabrous character,
  though incapable of blending with and modifying the rough leaves, was all
  the time latent in this family of plants. The numerous plants formerly
  referred to, which I raised from reciprocal crosses between the peloric
  and common Antirrhinum, offer a nearly parallel case; for in the first
  generation all the plants resembled the common form, and in the next
  generation, out of one hundred and thirty-seven plants, two alone were in
  an intermediate condition, the others perfectly resembling either the
  peloric or common form. Major Trevor Clarke also fertilised the
  above-mentioned red-flowered stock with pollen from the purple Queen
  stock, and about half the seedlings scarcely differed in habit, and not
  at all in the red colour of the flower, from the mother-plant, the other
  half bearing blossoms of a rich purple, closely like those of the
  paternal plant. Gärtner crossed many white and yellow-flowered species
  and varieties of Verbascum; and these colours were never blended, but the
  offspring bore either pure white or pure yellow blossoms; the former in
  the larger proportion.<a name="NtA_198"
  href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> Dr. Herbert raised many seedlings, as
  he informed me, from Swedish turnips crossed by two other varieties, and
  these never produced flowers of an intermediate tint, but always like one
  of their parents. I fertilised the purple sweet-pea (<i>Lathyrus
  odoratus</i>), which has a dark reddish-purple standard-petal and
  violet-coloured wings and keel, with pollen of the painted-lady
  sweet-pea, which has a pale cherry-coloured standard, and almost white
  wings and keel; and from the same pod I twice raised plants perfectly
  resembling both sorts; the greater number resembling the father. So
  perfect was the resemblance, that I should have thought there had <!--
  Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>been
  some mistake, if the plants which were at first identical with the
  paternal variety, namely, the painted-lady, had not later in the season
  produced, as mentioned in a former chapter, flowers blotched and streaked
  with dark purple. I raised grandchildren and great-grandchildren from
  these crossed plants, and they continued to resemble the painted-lady,
  but during the later generations became rather more blotched with purple,
  yet none reverted completely to the original mother-plant, the purple
  sweet-pea. The following case is slightly different, but still shows the
  same principle: Naudin<a name="NtA_199"
  href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> raised numerous hybrids between the
  yellow <i>Linaria vulgaris</i> and the purple <i>L. purpurea</i>, and
  during three successive generations the colours kept distinct in
  different parts of the same flower.</p>

  <p>From such cases as the foregoing, in which the offspring of the first
  generation perfectly resemble either parent, we come by a small step to
  those cases in which differently coloured flowers borne on the same root
  resemble both parents, and by another step to those in which the same
  flower or fruit is striped or blotched with the two parental colours, or
  bears a single stripe of the colour or other characteristic quality of
  one of the parent-forms. With hybrids and mongrels it frequently or even
  generally happens that one part of the body resembles more or less
  closely one parent and another part the other parent; and here again some
  resistance to fusion, or, what comes to the same thing, some mutual
  affinity between the organic atoms of the same nature, apparently comes
  into play, for otherwise all parts of the body would be equally
  intermediate in character. So again, when the offspring of hybrids or
  mongrels, which are themselves nearly intermediate in character, revert
  either wholly or by segments to their ancestors, the principle of the
  affinity of similar, or the repulsion of dissimilar atoms, must come into
  action. To this principle, which seems to be extremely general, we shall
  recur in the chapter on pangenesis.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable, as has been strongly insisted upon by Isidore
  Geoffroy St. Hilaire in regard to animals, that the transmission of
  characters without fusion occurs most rarely when species are crossed; I
  know of one exception alone, namely, with the hybrids naturally produced
  between the common and hooded crow (<i>Corvus corone</i> and
  <i>cornix</i>), which, however, are closely allied species, differing in
  nothing except colour. Nor have I met with any well-ascertained cases of
  transmission of this kind, even when one form is strongly prepotent over
  another, when two races are crossed which have been slowly formed by
  man's selection, and therefore resemble to a certain extent natural
  species. Such cases as puppies in the same litter closely resembling two
  distinct breeds, are probably due to super-f&oelig;tation,&mdash;that is,
  to the influence of two fathers. All the characters above enumerated,
  which are transmitted in a perfect state to some of the offspring and not
  to others,&mdash;such as distinct colours, nakedness of skin, smoothness
  of leaves, absence of horns or tail, additional toes, pelorism, dwarfed
  structure, &amp;c.,&mdash;have all been known to appear suddenly in
  individual animals and plants. From this fact, and from the several
  slight, aggregated differences which distinguish domestic races and
  species from <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span>each other, not being liable to this
  peculiar form of transmission, we may conclude that it is in some way
  connected with the sudden appearance of the characters in question.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>On the Modification of old Races and the Formation of new Races by
  Crossing.</i>&mdash;We have hitherto chiefly considered the effects of
  crossing in giving uniformity of character; we must now look to an
  opposite result. There can be no doubt that crossing, with the aid of
  rigorous selection during several generations, has been a potent means in
  modifying old races, and in forming new ones. Lord Orford crossed his
  famous stud of greyhounds once with the bulldog, which breed was chosen
  from being deficient in scenting powers, and from having what was wanted,
  courage and perseverance. In the course of six or seven generations all
  traces of the external form of the bulldog were eliminated, but courage
  and perseverance remained. Certain pointers have been crossed, as I hear
  from the Rev. W. D. Fox, with the foxhound, to give them dash and speed.
  Certain strains of Dorking fowls have had a slight infusion of Game
  blood; and I have known a great fancier who on a single occasion crossed
  his turbit-pigeons with barbs, for the sake of gaining greater breadth of
  beak.</p>

  <p>In the foregoing cases breeds have been crossed once, for the sake of
  modifying some particular character; but with most of the improved races
  of the pig, which now breed true, there have been repeated
  crosses,&mdash;for instance, the improved Essex owes its excellence to
  repeated crosses with the Neapolitan, together probably with some
  infusion of Chinese blood.<a name="NtA_200"
  href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> So with our British sheep: almost all
  the races, except the Southdown, have been largely crossed; "this, in
  fact, has been the history of our principal breeds."<a name="NtA_201"
  href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> To give an example, the "Oxfordshire
  Downs" now rank as an established breed.<a name="NtA_202"
  href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> They were produced about the year
  1830 by crossing "Hampshire and in some instances Southdown ewes with
  Cotswold rams:" now the Hampshire ram was itself produced by repeated
  crosses between the native <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>Hampshire sheep and Southdowns; and the
  long-woolled Cotswold were improved by crosses with the Leicester, which
  latter again is believed to have been a cross between several
  long-woolled sheep. Mr. Spooner, after considering the various cases
  which have been carefully recorded, concludes "that from a judicious
  pairing of cross-bred animals it is practicable to establish a new
  breed." On the Continent the history of several crossed races of cattle
  and of other animals has been well ascertained. To give one instance: the
  King of Wurtemberg, after twenty-five years' careful breeding, that is
  after six or seven generations, made a new breed of cattle from a cross
  between a Dutch and Swiss breed, combined with other breeds.<a
  name="NtA_203" href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> The Sebright bantam,
  which breeds as true as any other kind of fowl, was formed about sixty
  years ago by a complicated cross.<a name="NtA_204"
  href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> Dark Brahmas, which are believed by
  some fanciers to constitute a distinct species, were undoubtedly formed<a
  name="NtA_205" href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> in the United States,
  within a recent period, by a cross between Chittagongs and Cochins. With
  plants I believe there is little doubt that some kinds of turnips, now
  extensively cultivated, are crossed races; and the history of a variety
  of wheat which was raised from two very distinct varieties, and which
  after six years' culture presented an even sample, has been recorded on
  good authority.<a name="NtA_206" href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Until quite lately, cautious and experienced breeders, though not
  averse to a single infusion of foreign blood, were almost universally
  convinced that the attempt to establish a new race, intermediate between
  two widely distinct races, was hopeless: "they clung with superstitious
  tenacity to the doctrine of purity of blood, believing it to be the ark
  in which alone true safety could be found."<a name="NtA_207"
  href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> Nor was this conviction unreasonable:
  when two distinct races are crossed, the offspring of the first
  generation are generally nearly uniform in character; but even this
  sometimes fails to be the case, especially with crossed dogs and fowls,
  the young of which from the first are sometimes much <!-- Page 97
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>{97}</span>diversified. As
  cross-bred animals are generally of large size and vigorous, they have
  been raised in great numbers for immediate consumption. But for breeding
  they are found to be utterly useless; for though they may be themselves
  uniform in character, when paired together they yield during many
  generations offspring astonishingly diversified. The breeder is driven to
  despair, and concludes that he will never form an intermediate race. But
  from the cases already given, and from others which have been recorded,
  it appears that patience alone is necessary; as Mr. Spooner remarks,
  "nature opposes no barrier to successful admixture; in the course of
  time, by the aid of selection and careful weeding, it is practicable to
  establish a new breed." After six or seven generations the hoped-for
  result will in most cases be obtained; but even then an occasional
  reversion, or failure to keep true, may be expected. The attempt,
  however, will assuredly fail if the conditions of life be decidedly
  unfavourable to the characters of either parent-breed.<a name="NtA_208"
  href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although the grandchildren and succeeding generations of cross-bred
  animals are generally variable in an extreme degree, some curious
  exceptions to the rule have been observed, both with crossed races and
  species. Thus Boitard and Corbié<a name="NtA_209"
  href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> assert that from a Pouter and a Runt
  "a Cavalier will appear, which we have classed amongst pigeons of pure
  race, because it transmits all its qualities to its posterity." The
  editor of the 'Poultry Chronicle'<a name="NtA_210"
  href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> bred some bluish fowls from a black
  Spanish cock and a Malay hen; and these remained true to colour
  "generation after generation." The Himalayan breed of rabbits was
  certainly formed by crossing two sub-varieties of the silver-grey rabbit;
  although it suddenly assumed its present character, which differs much
  from that of either parent-breed, yet it has ever since been easily and
  truly propagated. I crossed some Labrador and Penguin ducks, and
  recrossed the mongrels with Penguins; afterwards, most of the ducks
  reared during three generations were nearly uniform in character, being
  brown with a white crescentic mark on the lower part of the breast, <!--
  Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>and with
  some white spots at the base of the beak; so that by the aid of a little
  selection a new breed might easily have been formed. In regard to crossed
  varieties of plants, Mr. Beaton remarks<a name="NtA_211"
  href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> that "Melville's extraordinary cross
  between the Scotch kale and an early cabbage is as true and genuine as
  any on record;" but in this case no doubt selection was practised.
  Gärtner<a name="NtA_212" href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> has given
  five cases of hybrids, in which the progeny kept constant; and hybrids
  between <i>Dianthus <span class="correction" title="Original reads `armoria', corrected by errata, page viii."
  >armeria</span></i> and <i>deltoides</i> remained true and uniform to the
  tenth generation. Dr. Herbert likewise showed me a hybrid from two
  species of Loasa which from its first production had kept constant during
  several generations.</p>

  <p>We have seen in the earlier chapters, that some of our domesticated
  animals, such as dogs, cattle, pigs, &amp;c., are almost certainly
  descended from more than one species, or wild race, if any one prefers to
  apply this latter term to forms which were enabled to keep distinct in a
  state of nature. Hence the crossing of aboriginally distinct species
  probably came into play at an early period in the formation of our
  present races. From Rütimeyer's observations there can be little doubt
  that this occurred with cattle; but in most cases some one of the forms
  which were allowed to cross freely, will, it is probable, have absorbed
  and obliterated the others. For it is not likely that semi-civilized men
  would have taken the necessary pains to modify by selection their
  commingled, crossed, and fluctuating stock. Nevertheless, those animals
  which were best adapted to their conditions of life would have survived
  through natural selection; and by this means crossing will often have
  indirectly aided in the formation of primeval domesticated breeds.</p>

  <p>Within recent times, as far as animals are concerned, the crossing of
  distinct species has done little or nothing in the formation or
  modification of our races. It is not yet known whether the species of
  silk-moth which have been recently crossed in France will yield permanent
  races. In the fourth chapter I alluded with some hesitation to the
  statement that a new breed, between the hare and rabbit, called
  leporides, had been formed in France, and was found capable of
  propagating <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span>itself; but it is now positively affirmed<a
  name="NtA_213" href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> that this is an error.
  With plants which can be multiplied by buds and cuttings, hybridisation
  has done wonders, as with many kinds of Roses, Rhododendrons,
  Pelargoniums, Calceolarias, and Petunias. Nearly all these plants can be
  propagated by seed; most of them freely; but extremely few or none come
  true by seed.</p>

  <p>Some authors believe that crossing is the chief cause of
  variability,&mdash;that is, of the appearance of absolutely new
  characters. Some have gone so far as to look at it as the sole cause; but
  this conclusion is disproved by some of the facts given in the chapter on
  Bud-variation. The belief that characters not present in either parent or
  in their ancestors frequently originate from crossing is doubtful; that
  they occasionally thus arise is probable; but this subject will be more
  conveniently discussed in a future chapter on the causes of
  Variability.</p>

  <p>A condensed summary of this and of the three following chapters,
  together with some remarks on Hybridism, will be given in the nineteenth
  chapter.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The domesticated races of both animals and plants, when crossed, are
  with extremely few exceptions quite prolific,&mdash;in some cases even
  more so than the purely bred parent-races. The offspring, also, raised
  from such crosses are likewise, as we shall see in the following chapter,
  generally more vigorous and fertile than their parents. On the other
  hand, species when crossed, and their hybrid offspring, are almost
  invariability in some degree sterile; and here there seems to exist a
  broad and insuperable distinction between races and species. The
  importance of this subject as bearing on the origin of species is
  obvious; and we shall hereafter recur to it.</p>

  <p>It is unfortunate how few precise observations have been made on the
  fertility of mongrel animals and plants during several successive
  generations. Dr. Broca<a name="NtA_214"
  href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> has remarked that no one has observed
  whether, for instance, mongrel dogs, bred <i>inter se</i>, are
  indefinitely fertile; yet, if a shade of infertility be detected by
  careful observation in the offspring of natural forms when crossed, it is
  thought that their specific distinction is proved. But so many breeds of
  sheep, cattle, pigs, dogs, and poultry, have been crossed and recrossed
  in various ways, that any sterility, if it had existed, would from being
  injurious <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>{101}</span>almost certainly have been observed. In
  investigating the fertility of crossed varieties many sources of doubt
  occur. Whenever the least trace of sterility between two plants, however
  closely allied, was observed by Kölreuter, and more especially by
  Gärtner, who counted the exact number of seed in each capsule, the two
  forms were at once ranked as distinct species; and if this rule be
  followed, assuredly it will never be proved that varieties when crossed
  are in any degree sterile. We have formerly seen that certain breeds of
  dogs do not readily pair together; but no observations have been made
  whether, when paired, they produce the full number of young, and whether
  the latter are perfectly fertile <i>inter se</i>; but, supposing that
  some degree of sterility were found to exist, naturalists would simply
  infer that these breeds were descended from aboriginally distinct
  species; and it would be scarcely possible to ascertain whether or not
  this explanation was the true one.</p>

  <p>The Sebright Bantam is much less prolific than any other breed of
  fowls, and is descended from a cross between two very distinct breeds,
  recrossed by a third sub-variety. But it would be extremely rash to infer
  that the loss of fertility was in any manner connected with its crossed
  origin, for it may with more probability be attributed either to
  long-continued close interbreeding, or to an innate tendency to sterility
  correlated with the absence of hackles and sickle tail-feathers.</p>

  <p>Before giving the few recorded cases of forms, which must be ranked as
  varieties, being in some degree sterile when crossed, I may remark that
  other causes sometimes interfere with varieties freely intercrossing.
  Thus they may differ too greatly in size, as with some kinds of dogs and
  fowls: for instance, the editor of the 'Journal of Horticulture,
  &amp;c.,'<a name="NtA_215" href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> says that
  he can keep Bantams with the larger breeds without much danger of their
  crossing, but not with the smaller breeds, such as Games, Hamburgs,
  &amp;c. With plants a difference in the period of flowering serves to
  keep varieties distinct, as with the various kinds of maize and wheat:
  thus Colonel Le Couteur<a name="NtA_216"
  href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> remarks, "the Talavera wheat, from
  flowering much earlier than any other kind, is sure to continue pure." In
  different parts of <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>{102}</span>the Falkland Islands the cattle are
  breaking up into herds of different colours; and those on the higher
  ground, which are generally white, usually breed, as I am informed by
  Admiral Sulivan, three months earlier than those on the lowlands; and
  this would manifestly tend to keep the herds from blending.</p>

  <p>Certain domestic races seem to prefer breeding with their own kind;
  and this is a fact of some importance, for it is a step towards that
  instinctive feeling which helps to keep closely allied species in a state
  of nature distinct. We have now abundant evidence that, if it were not
  for this feeling, many more hybrids would be naturally produced than is
  the case. We have seen in the first chapter that the alco dog of Mexico
  dislikes dogs of other breeds; and the hairless dog of Paraguay mixes
  less readily with the European races, than the latter do with each other.
  In Germany the female Spitz-dog is said to receive the fox more readily
  than will other dogs; a female Australian Dingo in England attracted the
  wild male foxes. But these differences in the sexual instinct and
  attractive power of the various breeds may be wholly due to their descent
  from distinct species. In Paraguay the horses have much freedom, and an
  excellent observer<a name="NtA_217" href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a>
  believes that the native horses of the same colour and size prefer
  associating with each other, and that the horses which have been imported
  from Entre Rios and Banda Oriental into Paraguay likewise prefer
  associating together. In Circassia six sub-races of the horse are known
  and have received distinct names; and a native proprietor of rank<a
  name="NtA_218" href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> asserts that horses of
  three of these races, whilst living a free life, almost always refuse to
  mingle and cross, and will even attack each other.</p>

  <p>It has been observed, in a district stocked with heavy Lincolnshire
  and light Norfolk sheep, that both kinds, though bred together, when
  turned out, "in a short time separate to a sheep;" the Lincolnshires
  drawing off to the rich soil, and the Norfolks to their own dry light
  soil; and as long as there is plenty of grass, "the two breeds keep
  themselves as distinct as rooks and pigeons." In this case different
  habits of <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page103"></a>{103}</span>life tend to keep the races distinct. On
  one of the Faroe islands, not more than half a mile in diameter, the
  half-wild native black sheep are said not to have readily mixed with the
  imported white sheep. It is a more curious fact that the semi-monstrous
  ancon sheep of modern origin "have been observed to keep together,
  separating themselves from the rest of the flock, when put into
  enclosures with other sheep."<a name="NtA_219"
  href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> With respect to fallow deer, which
  live in a semi-domesticated condition, Mr. Bennett<a name="NtA_220"
  href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> states that the dark and pale
  coloured herds, which have long been kept together in the Forest of Dean,
  in High Meadow Woods, and in the New Forest, have never been known to
  mingle: the dark-coloured deer, it may be added, are believed to have
  been first brought by James I. from Norway, on account of their greater
  hardiness. I imported from the island of Porto Santo two of the feral
  rabbits, which differ, as described in the fourth chapter, from common
  rabbits; both proved to be males, and, though they lived during some
  years in the Zoological Gardens, the superintendent, Mr. Bartlett, in
  vain endeavoured to make them breed with various tame kinds; but whether
  this refusal to breed was due to any change in instinct, or simply to
  their extreme wildness; or whether confinement had rendered them sterile,
  as often occurs, cannot be told.</p>

  <p>Whilst matching for the sake of experiment many of the most distinct
  breeds of pigeons, it frequently appeared to me that the birds, though
  faithful to their marriage vow, retained some desire after their own
  kind. Accordingly I asked Mr. Wicking, who has kept a larger stock of
  various breeds together than any man in England, whether he thought that
  they would prefer pairing with their own kind, supposing that there were
  males and females enough of each; and he without hesitation answered that
  he was convinced that this was the case. It has often been noticed that
  the dovecot pigeon seems to have an actual aversion towards the several
  fancy breeds;<a name="NtA_221" href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> yet
  all have <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span>certainly sprung from a common progenitor.
  The Rev. W.&nbsp;D. Fox informs me that his flocks of white and common Chinese
  geese kept distinct.</p>

  <p>These facts and statements, though some of them are incapable of
  proof, resting only on the opinion of experienced observers, show that
  some domestic races are led by different habits of life to keep to a
  certain extent separate, and that others prefer coupling with their own
  kind, in the same manner as species in a state of nature, though in a
  much less degree.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>With respect to sterility from the crossing of domestic races, I know
  of no well-ascertained case with animals. This fact, seeing the great
  difference in structure between some breeds of pigeons, fowls, pigs,
  dogs, &amp;c., is extraordinary, in contrast with the sterility of many
  closely allied natural species when crossed; but we shall hereafter
  attempt to show that it is not so extraordinary as it at first appears.
  And it may be well here to recall to mind that the amount of external
  difference between two species will not safely guide us in foretelling
  whether or not they will breed together,&mdash;some closely allied
  species when crossed being utterly sterile, and others which are
  extremely unlike being moderately fertile. I have said that no case of
  sterility in crossed races rests on satisfactory evidence; but here is
  one which at first seems trustworthy. Mr. Youatt,<a name="NtA_222"
  href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> and a better authority cannot be
  quoted, states, that formerly in Lancashire crosses were frequently made
  between longhorn and shorthorn cattle; the first cross was excellent, but
  the produce was uncertain; in the third or fourth generation the cows
  were bad milkers; "in addition to which, there was much uncertainty
  whether the cows would conceive; and full one-third of the cows among
  some of these half-breds failed to be in calf." This at first seems a
  good case; but Mr. Wilkinson states,<a name="NtA_223"
  href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> that a breed derived from this same
  cross was actually established in another part of England; and if it had
  failed in fertility, the fact would surely have been noticed. Moreover,
  supposing that Mr. Youatt had proved his case, it might be argued that
  the sterility was wholly due to the two parent-breeds being descended
  from primordially distinct species.</p>

  <p>I will give a case with plants, to show how difficult it is to get
  sufficient evidence. Mr. Sheriff, who has been so successful in the
  formation of new races of wheat, fertilised the Hopetoun with the
  Talavera; in the first and second generations the produce was
  intermediate in character, but in the fourth generation "it was found to
  consist of many varieties; nine-tenths of the florets proved barren, and
  many of the seeds seemed shrivelled abortions, void of vitality, and the
  whole race was evidently verging to extinction."<a name="NtA_224"
  href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> Now, considering how little these
  <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>{105}</span>varieties of wheat differ in any important
  character, it seems to me very improbable that the sterility resulted, as
  Mr. Sheriff thought, from the cross, but from some quite distinct cause.
  Until such experiments are many times repeated, it would be rash to trust
  them; but unfortunately they have been rarely tried even once with
  sufficient care.</p>

  <p>Gärtner has recorded a more remarkable and trustworthy case: he
  fertilised thirteen panicles (and subsequently nine others) on a dwarf
  maize bearing yellow seed<a name="NtA_225"
  href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a> with pollen of a tall maize having
  red seed; and one head alone produced good seed, only five in number.
  Though these plants are mon&oelig;cious, and therefore do not require
  castration, yet I should have suspected some accident in the manipulation
  had not Gärtner expressly stated that he had during many years grown
  these two varieties together, and they did not spontaneously cross; and
  this, considering that the plants are mon&oelig;cious and abound with
  pollen, and are well known generally to cross freely, seems explicable
  only on the belief that these two varieties are in some degree mutually
  infertile. The hybrid plants raised from the above five seed were
  intermediate in structure, extremely variable, and perfectly fertile.<a
  name="NtA_226" href="#Nt_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> No one, I believe, has
  hitherto suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct species;
  but had the hybrids been in the least sterile, no doubt Gärtner would at
  once have so classed them. I may here remark, that with undoubted species
  there is not necessarily any close relation between the sterility of a
  first cross and that of the hybrid offspring. Some species can be crossed
  with facility, but produce utterly sterile hybrids; others can be crossed
  with extreme difficulty, but the hybrids when produced are moderately
  fertile. I am not aware, however, of any instance quite like this of the
  maize with natural species, namely, of a first cross made with
  difficulty, but yielding perfectly fertile hybrids.</p>

  <p>The following case is much more remarkable, and evidently perplexed
  Gärtner, whose strong wish it was to draw a broad line of distinction
  between species and varieties. In the genus Verbascum, he made, during
  eighteen years, a vast number of experiments, and crossed no less than
  1085 flowers and counted their seeds. Many of these experiments consisted
  in crossing white and yellow varieties of both <i>V. lychnitis</i> and
  <i>V. blattaria</i> with nine other species and their hybrids. That the
  white and yellow flowered plants of these two species are really
  varieties, no one has doubted; and Gärtner actually raised in the case of
  both species one variety from the seed of the other. Now in two of his
  works<a name="NtA_227" href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> he distinctly
  asserts that crosses between similarly-coloured flowers yield more seed
  than between dissimilarly-coloured; so that the yellow-flowered variety
  of either species (and conversely with the white-flowered variety), when
  crossed with pollen of its own kind, yields more seed than when crossed
  with that of the white variety; and so it is when differently coloured
  species are crossed. The general results may be seen in the Table at the
  <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>{106}</span>end of his volume. In one instance he
  gives<a name="NtA_228" href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> the following
  details; but I must premise that Gärtner, to avoid exaggerating the
  degree of sterility in his crosses, always compares the <i>maximum</i>
  number obtained from a cross with the <i>average</i> number naturally
  given by the pure mother-plant. The white-variety of <i>V. lychnitis</i>,
  naturally fertilised by its own pollen, gave from an <i>average</i> of
  twelve capsules ninety-six good seeds in each; whilst twenty flowers
  fertilised with pollen from the yellow variety of this same species, gave
  as the <i>maximum</i> only eighty-nine good seed; so that we have the
  proportion of 1000 to 908, according to Gärtner's usual scale. I should
  have thought it possible that so small a difference in fertility might
  have been accounted for by the evil effects of the necessary castration;
  but Gärtner shows that the white variety of <i>V. lychnitis</i>, when
  fertilised first by the white variety of <i>V. blattaria</i>, and then by
  the yellow variety of this species, yielded seed in the proportion of 622
  to 438; and in both these cases castration was performed. Now the
  sterility which results from the crossing of the differently coloured
  varieties of the same species, is fully as great as that which occurs in
  many cases when distinct species are crossed. Unfortunately Gärtner
  compared the results of the first unions alone, and not the sterility of
  the two sets of hybrids produced from the white variety of <i>V.
  lychnitis</i> when fertilised by the white and yellow varieties of <i>V.
  blattaria</i>, for it is probable that they would have differed in this
  respect.</p>

  <p>Mr. J. Scott has given me the results of a series of experiments on
  Verbascum, made by him in the Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh. He repeated
  some of Gärtner's experiments on distinct species, but obtained only
  fluctuating results; some confirmatory, but the greater number
  contradictory; nevertheless these seem hardly sufficient to overthrow the
  conclusions arrived at by Gärtner from experiments tried on a much larger
  scale. In the second place Mr. Scott experimented on the relative
  fertility of unions between similarly and dissimilarly-coloured varieties
  of the same species. Thus he fertilised six flowers of the yellow variety
  of <i>V. lychnitis</i> by its own pollen, and obtained six capsules, and
  calling, for the sake of having a standard of comparison, the average
  number of good seed in each one hundred, he found that this same yellow
  variety, when fertilised by the white variety, yielded from seven
  capsules an average of ninety-four seed. On the same principle, the white
  variety of <i>V. lychnitis</i> by its own pollen (from six capsules), and
  by the pollen of the yellow variety (eight capsules), yielded seed in the
  proportion of 100 to 82. The yellow variety of <i>V. thapsus</i> by its
  own pollen (eight capsules), and by that of the white variety (only two
  capsules), yielded seed in the proportion of 100 to 94. Lastly, the white
  variety of <i>V. blattaria</i> by its own pollen (eight capsules), and by
  that of the yellow variety (five capsules), yielded seed in the
  proportion of 100 to 79. So that in every case the unions of
  dissimilarly-coloured varieties of the same species were less fertile
  than the unions of similarly-coloured varieties; when all the cases are
  grouped together, the difference of fertility is as 86 to 100. Some
  additional trials were made, and altogether thirty-six similarly-coloured
  unions yielded thirty-five good <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page107"></a>{107}</span>capsules; whilst thirty-five
  dissimilarly-coloured unions yielded only twenty-six good capsules.
  Besides the foregoing experiments, the purple <i>V. ph&oelig;niceum</i>
  was crossed by a rose-coloured and a white variety of the same species;
  these two varieties were also crossed together, and these several unions
  yielded less seed than <i>V. ph&oelig;niceum</i> by its own pollen. Hence
  it follows from Mr. Scott's experiments, that in the genus Verbascum the
  similarly and dissimilarly-coloured varieties of the same species behave,
  when crossed, like closely allied but distinct species.<a name="NtA_229"
  href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This remarkable fact of the sexual affinity of similarly-coloured
  varieties, as observed by Gärtner and Mr. Scott, may not be of very rare
  occurrence; for the subject has not been attended to by others. The
  following case is worth giving, partly to show how difficult it is to
  avoid error. Dr. Herbert<a name="NtA_230"
  href="#Nt_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a> has remarked that variously-coloured
  double varieties of the hollyhock (<i>Althæa rosea</i>) may be raised
  with certainty by seed from plants growing close together. I have been
  informed that nurserymen who raise seed for sale do not separate their
  plants; accordingly I procured seed of eighteen named varieties; of
  these, eleven varieties produced sixty-two plants all perfectly true to
  their kind; and seven produced forty-nine plants, half of which were true
  and half false. Mr. Masters of Canterbury has given me a more striking
  case; he saved seed from a great bed of twenty-four named varieties
  planted in closely adjoining rows, and each variety reproduced itself
  truly with only sometimes a shade of difference in tint. Now in the
  hollyhock the pollen, which is abundant, is matured and nearly all shed
  before the stigma of the same flower is ready to receive it;<a
  name="NtA_231" href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> and as bees covered
  with pollen incessantly fly from plant to plant, it would appear that
  adjoining varieties could not escape being crossed. As, however, this
  does not occur, it appeared to me probable that the pollen <!-- Page 108
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span>of each
  variety was prepotent on its own stigma over that of all other varieties.
  But Mr. C. Turner of Slough, well known for his success in the
  cultivation of this plant, informs me that it is the doubleness of the
  flowers which prevents the bees gaining access to the pollen and stigma;
  and he finds that it is difficult even to cross them artificially.
  Whether this explanation will fully account for varieties in close
  proximity propagating themselves so truly by seed, I do not know.</p>

  <p>The following cases are worth giving, as they relate to
  mon&oelig;cious forms, which do not require, and consequently have not
  been injured by, castration. Girou de Buzareingues crossed what he
  designates three varieties of gourd,<a name="NtA_232"
  href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a> and asserts that their mutual
  fertilisation is less easy in proportion to the difference which they
  present. I am aware how imperfectly the forms in this group were until
  recently known; but Sageret,<a name="NtA_233"
  href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> who ranked them according to their
  mutual fertility, considers the three forms above alluded to as
  varieties, as does a far higher authority, namely, M. Naudin.<a
  name="NtA_234" href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> Sageret<a
  name="NtA_235" href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> has observed that
  certain melons have a greater tendency, whatever the cause may be, to
  keep true than others; and M. Naudin, who has had such immense experience
  in this group, informs me that he believes that certain varieties
  intercross more readily than others of the same species; but he has not
  proved the truth of this conclusion; the frequent abortion of the pollen
  near Paris being one great difficulty. Nevertheless, he has grown close
  together, during seven years, certain forms of Citrullus, which, as they
  could be artificially crossed with perfect facility and produced fertile
  offspring, are ranked as varieties; but these forms when not artificially
  crossed kept true. Many other varieties, on the other hand, in the same
  group cross with such facility, as M. Naudin repeatedly insists, that
  without being grown far apart they cannot be kept in the least true.</p>

  <p>Another case, though somewhat different, may be here given, as it is
  highly remarkable, and is established on excellent evidence. Kölreuter
  minutely describes five varieties of the common tobacco,<a name="NtA_236"
  href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a> which were reciprocally crossed, and
  the offspring were intermediate in character and as fertile as their
  parents: from this fact Kölreuter inferred that they are really
  varieties; and no one, as far as I can discover, seems to have doubted
  that such is the case. He also crossed reciprocally these five varieties
  with <i>N. glutinosa</i>, and they yielded very sterile hybrids; but
  those raised from the <i>var. perennis</i>, whether used as the father or
  mother plant, were not so sterile as the hybrids from the four other
  varieties.<a name="NtA_237" href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> So that
  the sexual <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span>capacity of this one variety has certainly
  been in some degree modified, so as to approach in nature that of <i>N.
  glutinosa</i>.<a name="NtA_238" href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These facts with respect to plants show that in some few cases certain
  varieties have had their sexual powers so far modified, that they cross
  together less readily and yield less seed than other varieties of the
  same species. We shall presently see that the sexual functions of most
  animals and plants are eminently liable to be affected by the conditions
  of life to which they are exposed; and hereafter we shall briefly discuss
  the conjoint bearing of this and other facts on the difference in
  fertility between crossed varieties and crossed species.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Domestication eliminates the tendency to Sterility which is general
with Species when crossed.</i></p>

  <p>This hypothesis was first propounded by Pallas,<a name="NtA_239"
  href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> and has been adopted by several
  authors. I can find hardly any direct facts in its support; but
  unfortunately no one has compared, in the case of either animals or
  plants, the fertility of anciently domesticated varieties, when crossed
  with a distinct species, with that of the wild parent-species when
  similarly crossed. No one has compared, for instance, the fertility of
  <i>Gallus bankiva</i> and of the domesticated fowl, when crossed with a
  distinct species of Gallus or Phasianus; and the <!-- Page 110 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>{110}</span>experiment would in all
  cases be surrounded by many difficulties. Dureau de la Malle, who has so
  closely studied classical literature, states<a name="NtA_240"
  href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> that in the time of the Romans the
  common mule was produced with more difficulty than at the present day;
  but whether this statement may be trusted I know not. A much more
  important, though somewhat different, case is given by M. Groenland,<a
  name="NtA_241" href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> namely, that plants,
  known from their intermediate character and sterility to be hybrids
  between Ægilops and wheat, have perpetuated themselves under culture
  since 1857, <i>with a rapid but varying increase of fertility in each
  generation</i>. In the fourth generation the plants, still retaining
  their intermediate character, had become as fertile as common cultivated
  wheat.</p>

  <p>The indirect evidence in favour of the Pallasian doctrine appears to
  me to be extremely strong. In the earlier chapters I have attempted to
  show that our various breeds of dogs are descended from several wild
  species; and this probably is the case with sheep. There can no longer be
  any doubt that the Zebu or humped Indian ox belongs to a distinct species
  from European cattle: the latter, moreover, are descended from two or
  three forms, which may be called either species or wild races, but which
  co-existed in a state of nature and kept distinct. We have good evidence
  that our domesticated pigs belong to at least two specific types, <i>S.
  scrofa</i> and <i>Indica</i>, which probably lived together in a wild
  state in South-eastern Europe. Now, a widely-extended analogy leads to
  the belief that if these several allied species, in the wild state or
  when first reclaimed, had been crossed, they would have exhibited, both
  in their first unions and in their hybrid offspring, some degree of
  sterility. Nevertheless the several domesticated races descended from
  them are now all, as far as can be ascertained, perfectly fertile
  together. If this reasoning be trustworthy, and it is apparently sound,
  we must admit the Pallasian doctrine that long-continued domestication
  tends to eliminate that sterility which is natural to species when
  crossed in their aboriginal state.</p>

<p><!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>On increased Fertility from Domestication and Cultivation.</i></p>

  <p>Increased fertility from domestication, without any reference to
  crossing, may be here briefly considered. This subject bears indirectly
  on two or three points connected with the modification of organic beings.
  As Buffon long ago remarked,<a name="NtA_242"
  href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> domestic animals breed oftener in the
  year and produce more young at a birth than wild animals of the same
  species; they, also, sometimes breed at an earlier age. The case would
  hardly have deserved further notice, had not some authors lately
  attempted to show that fertility increases and decreases in an inverse
  ratio with the amount of food. This strange doctrine has apparently
  arisen from individual animals when supplied with an inordinate quantity
  of food, and from plants of many kinds when grown on excessively rich
  soil, as on a dunghill, becoming sterile; but to this latter point I
  shall have occasion presently to return. With hardly an exception, our
  domesticated animals, which have long been habituated to a regular and
  copious supply of food, without the labour of searching for it, are more
  fertile than the corresponding wild animals. It is notorious how
  frequently cats and dogs breed, and how many young they produce at a
  birth. The wild rabbit is said generally to breed four times yearly, and
  to produce from four to eight young; the tame rabbit breeds six or seven
  times yearly, and produces from four to eleven young. The ferret, though
  generally so closely confined, is more prolific than its supposed wild
  prototype. The wild sow is remarkably prolific, for she often breeds
  twice in the year, and produces from four to eight and sometimes even
  twelve young at a birth; but the domestic sow regularly breeds twice a
  year, and would breed oftener if permitted; and a sow that produces less
  than eight at a birth "is worth little, and the sooner she is fattened
  for the butcher the better." The amount of food affects the fertility
  even of the same individual: thus sheep, which on mountains never produce
  more than one lamb at a birth, when brought <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span>down to lowland
  pastures frequently bear twins. This difference apparently is not due to
  the cold of the higher land, for sheep and other domestic animals are
  said to be extremely prolific in Lapland. Hard living, also, retards the
  period at which animals conceive; for it has been found disadvantageous
  in the northern islands of Scotland to allow cows to bear calves before
  they are four years old.<a name="NtA_243"
  href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Birds offer still better evidence of increased fertility from
  domestication: the hen of the wild <i>Gallus bankiva</i> lays from six to
  ten eggs, a number which would be thought nothing of with the domestic
  hen. The wild duck lays from five to ten eggs; the tame one in the course
  of the year from eighty to one hundred. The wild grey-lag goose lays from
  five to eight eggs; the tame from thirteen to eighteen, and she lays a
  second time; as Mr. Dixon has remarked, "high-feeding, care, and moderate
  warmth induce a habit of prolificacy which becomes in some measure
  hereditary." Whether the semi-domesticated dovecot pigeon is more fertile
  than the wild rock-pigeon <i>C. livia</i>, I know not; but the more
  thoroughly domesticated breeds are nearly twice as fertile as dovecots:
  the latter, however, when caged and highly fed, become equally fertile
  with house pigeons. The peahen alone of domesticated birds is rather more
  fertile, according to some accounts, when wild in its native Indian home,
  than when domesticated in Europe and exposed to our much colder
  climate.<a name="NtA_244" href="#Nt_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With respect to plants, no one would expect wheat to tiller more, and
  each ear to produce more grain, in poor than in rich soil; or to get in
  poor soil a heavy crop of peas or beans. Seeds vary so much in number
  <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>that it is difficult to estimate them; but
  on comparing beds of carrots saved for seed in a nursery garden with wild
  plants, the former seemed to produce about twice as much seed. Cultivated
  cabbages yielded thrice as many pods by measure as wild cabbages from the
  rocks of South Wales. The excess of berries produced by the cultivated
  Asparagus in comparison with the wild plant is enormous. No doubt many
  highly cultivated plants, such as pears, pineapples, bananas, sugar-cane,
  &amp;c., are nearly or quite sterile; and I am inclined to attribute this
  sterility to excess of food and to other unnatural conditions; but to
  this subject I shall presently recur.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In some cases, as with the pig, rabbit, &amp;c., and with those plants
  which are valued for their seed, the direct selection of the more fertile
  individuals has probably much increased their fertility; and in all cases
  this may have occurred indirectly, from the better chance of the more
  numerous offspring produced by the more fertile individuals having
  survived. But with cats, ferrets, and dogs, and with plants like carrots,
  cabbages, and asparagus, which are not valued for their prolificacy,
  selection can have played only a subordinate part; and their increased

  <p>The gain in constitutional vigour, derived from an occasional cross
  between individuals of the same variety, but belonging to distinct
  families, or between distinct varieties, has not been so largely or so
  frequently discussed, as have the evil effects of too close
  interbreeding. But the former point is the more important of the two,
  inasmuch as the evidence is more decisive. The evil results from close
  interbreeding are difficult to detect, for they accumulate slowly, and
  differ much in degree with different species; whilst the good effects
  which almost invariably follow a cross are from the first manifest. It
  should, however, be clearly understood that the advantage of close
  interbreeding, as far as the retention of character is concerned, is
  indisputable, and often outweighs the evil of a slight loss of
  constitutional vigour. In relation to the subject of domestication, the
  whole question is of some importance, as too close interbreeding
  interferes with the improvement of old races, and especially with the
  formation of new ones. It is important as indirectly bearing on
  Hybridism; and perhaps on the extinction of species, when any form has
  become so rare that only a few individuals <!-- Page 115 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>{115}</span>remain within a
  confined area. It bears in an important manner on the influence of free
  intercrossing, in obliterating individual differences, and thus giving
  uniformity of character to the individuals of the same race or species;
  for if additional vigour and fertility be thus gained, the crossed
  offspring will multiply and prevail, and the ultimate result will be far
  greater than otherwise would have occurred. Lastly, the question is of
  high interest, as bearing on mankind. Hence I shall discuss this subject
  at full length. As the facts which prove the evil effects of close
  interbreeding are more copious, though less decisive, than those on the
  good effects of crossing, I shall, under each group of beings, begin with
  the former.</p>

  <p>There is no difficulty in defining what is meant by a cross; but this
  is by no means easy in regard to "breeding in and in" or "too close
  interbreeding," because, as we shall see, different species of animals
  are differently affected by the same degree of interbreeding. The pairing
  of a father and daughter, or mother and son, or brothers and sisters, if
  carried on during several generations, is the closest possible form of
  interbreeding. But some good judges, for instance Sir J. Sebright,
  believe that the pairing of a brother and sister is closer than that of
  parents and children; for when the father is matched with his daughter he
  crosses, as is said, with only half his own blood. The consequences of
  close interbreeding carried on for too long a time, are, as is generally
  believed, loss of size, constitutional vigour, and fertility, sometimes
  accompanied by a tendency to malformation. Manifest evil does not usually
  follow from pairing the nearest relations for two, three, or even four
  generations; but several causes interfere with our detecting the
  evil&mdash;such as the deterioration being very gradual, and the
  difficulty of distinguishing between such direct evil and the inevitable
  augmentation of any morbid tendencies which may be latent or apparent in
  the related parents. On the other hand, the benefit from a cross, even
  when there has not been any very close interbreeding, is almost
  invariably at once conspicuous. There is reason to believe, and this was
  the opinion of that most experienced observer Sir J. Sebright,<a
  name="NtA_245" href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> that the evil effects
  of close interbreeding may be checked by the related individuals <!--
  Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span>being
  separated during a few generations and exposed to different conditions of
  life.</p>

  <p>That evil directly follows from any degree of close interbreeding has
  been denied by many persons; but rarely by any practical breeder; and
  never, as far as I know, by one who has largely bred animals which
  propagate their kind quickly. Many physiologists attribute the evil
  exclusively to the combination and consequent increase of morbid
  tendencies common to both parents: that this is an active source of
  mischief there can be no doubt. It is unfortunately too notorious that
  men and various domestic animals endowed with a wretched constitution,
  and with a strong hereditary disposition to disease, if not actually ill,
  are fully capable of procreating their kind. Close interbreeding, on the
  other hand, induces sterility; and this indicates something quite
  distinct from the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both
  parents. The evidence immediately to be given convinces me that it is a
  great law of nature, that all organic beings profit from an occasional
  cross with individuals not closely related to them in blood; and that, on
  the other hand, long-continued close interbreeding is injurious.</p>

  <p>Various general considerations have had much influence in leading me
  to this conclusion; but the reader will probably rely more on special
  facts and opinions. The authority of experienced observers, even when
  they do not advance the grounds of their belief, is of some little value.
  Now almost all men who have bred many kinds of animals and have written
  on the subject, such as Sir J. Sebright, Andrew Knight, &amp;c.,<a
  name="NtA_246" href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> have expressed the
  strongest conviction on the impossibility of long-continued close
  interbreeding. Those who have compiled works on agriculture, and have
  associated much with breeders, such as the sagacious Youatt, Low,
  &amp;c., have strongly declared their opinion to the same effect. Prosper
  Lucas, trusting largely to French authorities, has come to a similar
  conclusion. The distinguished German agriculturist Hermann von Nathusius,
  who has written the most able treatise on this subject which I have met
  with, concurs; and as I shall have to quote from <!-- Page 117 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span>this treatise, I may
  state that Nathusius is not only intimately acquainted with works on
  agriculture in all languages, and knows the pedigrees of our British
  breeds better than most Englishmen, but has imported many of our improved
  animals, and is himself an experienced breeder.</p>

  <p>Evidence of the evil effects of close interbreeding can most readily
  be acquired in the case of animals, such as fowls, pigeons, &amp;c.,
  which propagate quickly, and, from being kept in the same place, are
  exposed to the same conditions. Now I have inquired of very many breeders
  of these birds, and I have hitherto not met with a single man who was not
  thoroughly convinced that an occasional cross with another strain of the
  same sub-variety was absolutely necessary. Most breeders of
  highly-improved or fancy birds value their own strain, and are most
  unwilling, at the risk, in their opinion, of deterioration, to make a
  cross. The purchase of a first-rate bird of another strain is expensive,
  and exchanges are troublesome; yet all breeders, as far as I can hear,
  excepting those who keep large stocks at different places for the sake of
  crossing, are driven after a time to take this step.</p>

  <p>Another general consideration which has had great influence on my mind
  is, that with all hermaphrodite animals and plants, which it might have
  been thought would have perpetually fertilised themselves, and thus have
  been subjected for long ages to the closest interbreeding, there is no
  single species, as far as I can discover, in which the structure ensures
  self-fertilisation. On the contrary, there are in a multitude of cases,
  as briefly stated in the fifteenth chapter, manifest adaptations which
  favour or inevitably lead to an occasional cross between one
  hermaphrodite and another of the same species; and these adaptive
  structures are utterly purposeless, as far as we can see, for any other
  end.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>With <i>Cattle</i> there can be no doubt that extremely close
  interbreeding may be long carried on, advantageously with respect to
  external characters and with no manifestly apparent evil as far as
  constitution is concerned. The same remark is applicable to sheep.
  Whether these animals have gradually been rendered less susceptible than
  others to this evil, in order to permit them to live in herds,&mdash;a
  habit which leads the old and vigorous males to expel all intruders, and
  in consequence often to pair with their own daughters, I will not pretend
  to decide. The case of Bakewell's Long-horns, which were closely
  interbred for a long period, has often been <!-- Page 118 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span>quoted; yet Youatt
  says<a name="NtA_247" href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> the breed "had
  acquired a delicacy of constitution inconsistent with common management,"
  and "the propagation of the species was not always certain." But the
  Shorthorns offer the most striking case of close interbreeding; for
  instance, the famous bull Favourite (who was himself the offspring of a
  half-brother and sister from Foljambe) was matched with his own daughter,
  granddaughter, and great-granddaughter; so that the produce of this last
  union, or the great-great-granddaughter, had 15-16ths, or 93.75 per cent.
  of the blood of Favourite in her veins. This cow was matched with the
  bull Wellington, having 62.5 per cent. of Favourite blood in his veins,
  and produced Clarissa; Clarissa was matched with the bull Lancaster,
  having 68.75 of the same blood, and she yielded valuable offspring.<a
  name="NtA_248" href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> Nevertheless Collings,
  who reared these animals, and was a strong advocate for close breeding,
  once crossed his stock with a Galloway, and the cows from this cross
  realised the highest prices. Bates's herd was esteemed the most
  celebrated in the world. For thirteen years he bred most closely in and
  in; but during the next seventeen years, though he had the most exalted
  notion of the value of his own stock, he thrice infused fresh blood into
  his herd: it is said that he did this, not to improve the form of his
  animals, but on account of their lessened fertility. Mr. Bates's own
  view, as given by a celebrated breeder,<a name="NtA_249"
  href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> was, that "to breed in and in from a
  bad stock was ruin and devastation; yet that the practice may be safely
  followed within certain limits when the parents so related are descended
  from first-rate animals." We thus see that there has been extremely close
  interbreeding with Shorthorns; but Nathusius, after the most careful
  study of their pedigrees, says that he can find no instance of a breeder
  who has strictly followed this practice during his whole life. From this
  study and his own experience, he concludes that close interbreeding is
  necessary to ennoble the stock; but that in effecting this the greatest
  care is necessary, on account of the tendency to infertility and
  weakness. It may be added, that another high authority<a name="NtA_250"
  href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> asserts that many more calves are
  born cripples from Shorthorns than from other and less closely interbred
  races of cattle.</p>

  <p>Although by carefully selecting the best animals (as Nature
  effectually does by the law of battle) close interbreeding may be long
  carried on with cattle, yet the good effects of a cross between almost
  any two breeds is at once shown by the greater size and vigour of the
  offspring; as Mr. Spooner writes to me, "crossing distinct breeds
  certainly improves cattle for the butcher." Such crossed animals are of
  course of no value to the breeder; but they have been raised during many
  years in several <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>{119}</span>parts of England to be slaughtered;<a
  name="NtA_251" href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> and their merit is now
  so fully recognised, that at fat-cattle shows a separate class has been
  formed for their reception. The best fat ox at the great show at
  Islington in 1862 was a crossed animal.</p>

  <p>The half-wild cattle, which have been kept in British parks probably
  for 400 or 500 years, or even for a longer period, have been advanced by
  Culley and others as a case of long-continued interbreeding within the
  limits of the same herd without any consequent injury. With respect to
  the cattle at Chillingham, the late Lord Tankerville owned that they were
  bad breeders.<a name="NtA_252" href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a> The
  agent, Mr. Hardy, estimates (in a letter to me, dated May, 1861) that in
  the herd of about fifty the average number annually slaughtered, killed
  by fighting, and dying, is about ten, or one in five. As the herd is kept
  up to nearly the same average number, the annual rate of increase must be
  likewise about one in five. The bulls, I may add, engage in furious
  battles, of which battles the present Lord Tankerville has given me a
  graphic description, so that there will always be rigorous selection of
  the most vigorous males. I procured in 1855 from Mr. D. Gardner, agent to
  the Duke of Hamilton, the following account of the wild cattle kept in
  the Duke's park in Lanarkshire, which is about 200 acres in extent. The
  number of cattle varies from sixty-five to eighty; and the number
  annually killed (I presume by all causes) is from eight to ten; so that
  the annual rate of increase can hardly be more than one in six. Now in
  South America, where the herds are half-wild, and therefore offer a
  nearly fair standard of comparison, according to Azara the natural
  increase of the cattle on an estancia is from one-third to one-fourth of
  the total number, or one in between three and four; and this, no doubt,
  applies exclusively to adult animals fit for consumption. Hence the
  half-wild British cattle which have long interbred within the limits of
  the same herd are relatively far less fertile. Although in an unenclosed
  country like Paraguay there must be some crossing between the different
  herds, yet even there the inhabitants believe that the occasional
  introduction of animals from distant localities is necessary to prevent
  "degeneration in size and diminution of fertility."<a name="NtA_253"
  href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> The decrease in size from ancient
  times in the Chillingham and Hamilton cattle must have been prodigious,
  for Professor Rütimeyer has shown that they are almost certainly the
  descendants of the gigantic <i>Bos primigenius</i>. No doubt this
  decrease in size may be largely attributed to less favourable conditions
  of life; yet animals roaming over large parks, and fed during severe
  winters, can hardly be considered as placed under very unfavourable
  conditions.</p>

  <p>With <i>Sheep</i> there has often been long-continued interbreeding
  within the limits of the same flock; but whether the nearest relations
  have been matched so frequently as in the case of Shorthorn cattle, I do
  not know. The Messrs. Brown during fifty years have never infused fresh
  blood into their excellent flock of Leicesters. Since 1810 Mr. Barford
  has acted on the same principle with the Foscote flock. He asserts that
  half a century <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>of experience has convinced him that when
  two nearly related animals are quite sound in constitution, in-and-in
  breeding does not induce degeneracy; but he adds that he "does not pride
  himself on breeding from the nearest affinities." In France the Naz flock
  has been bred for sixty years without the introduction of a single
  strange ram.<a name="NtA_254" href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a>
  Nevertheless, most great breeders of sheep have protested against close
  interbreeding prolonged for too great a length of time.<a name="NtA_255"
  href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> The most celebrated of recent
  breeders, Jonas Webb, kept five separate families to work on, thus
  "retaining the requisite distance of relationship between the sexes."<a
  name="NtA_256" href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although by the aid of careful selection the near interbreeding of
  sheep may be long continued without any manifest evil, yet it has often
  been the practice with farmers to cross distinct breeds to obtain animals
  for the butcher, which plainly shows that good is derived from this
  practice. Mr. Spooner sums up his excellent Essay on Crossing by
  asserting that there is a direct pecuniary advantage in judicious
  cross-breeding, especially when the male is larger than the female. A
  former celebrated breeder, Lord Somerville, distinctly states that his
  half-breeds from Ryelands and Spanish sheep were larger animals than
  either the pure Ryelands or pure Spanish sheep.<a name="NtA_257"
  href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As some of our British parks are ancient, it occurred to me that there
  must have been long-continued close interbreeding with the fallow deer
  (<i>Cervus dama</i>) kept in them; but on inquiry I find that it is a
  common practice to infuse new blood by procuring bucks from other parks.
  Mr. Shirley,<a name="NtA_258" href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a> who has
  carefully studied the management of deer, admits that in some parks there
  has been no admixture of foreign blood from a time beyond the memory of
  man. But he concludes "that in the end the constant breeding in-and-in is
  sure to tell to the disadvantage of the whole herd, though it may take a
  very long time to prove it; moreover, when we find, as is very constantly
  the case, that the introduction of fresh blood has been of the very
  greatest use to deer, both by improving their size and appearance, and
  particularly by being of service in removing the taint of 'rickback,' if
  not of other diseases, to which deer are sometimes subject when the blood
  has not been changed, there can, I think, be no doubt but that a
  judicious cross with a good stock is of the greatest consequence, and is
  indeed essential, sooner or later, to the prosperity of every
  well-ordered park."</p>

  <p>Mr. Meynell's famous foxhounds have been adduced, as showing that no
  ill effects follow from close interbreeding; and Sir J. Sebright
  ascertained from him that he frequently bred from father and daughter,
  mother and <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span>son, and sometimes even from brothers and
  sisters. Sir J. Sebright, however, declares,<a name="NtA_259"
  href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> that by breeding <i>in-and-in</i>, by
  which he means matching brothers and sisters, he has actually seen strong
  spaniels become weak and diminutive lapdogs. The Rev. W.&nbsp;D. Fox has
  communicated to me the case of a small lot of bloodhounds, long kept in
  the same family, which had become very bad breeders, and nearly all had a
  bony enlargement in the tail. A single cross with a distinct strain of
  bloodhounds restored their fertility, and drove away the tendency to
  malformation in the tail. I have heard the particulars of another case
  with bloodhounds, in which the female had to be held to the male.
  Considering how rapid is the natural increase of the dog, it is difficult
  to understand the high price of most highly improved breeds, which almost
  implies long-continued close interbreeding, except on the belief that
  this process lessens fertility and increases liability to distemper and
  other diseases. A high authority, Mr. Scrope, attributes the rarity and
  deterioration in size of the Scotch deerhound (the few individuals now
  existing throughout the country being all related) in large part to close
  interbreeding.</p>

  <p>With all highly-bred animals there is more or less difficulty in
  getting them to procreate quickly, and all suffer much from delicacy of
  constitution; but I do not pretend that these effects ought to be wholly
  attributed to close interbreeding. A great judge of rabbits<a
  name="NtA_260" href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> says, "the long-eared
  does are often too highly bred or forced in their youth to be of much
  value as breeders, often turning out barren or bad mothers." Again: "Very
  long-eared bucks will also sometimes prove barren." These highly-bred
  rabbits often desert their young, so that it is necessary to have
  nurse-rabbits.</p>

  <p>With <i>Pigs</i> there is more unanimity amongst breeders on the evil
  effects of close interbreeding than, perhaps, with any other large
  animal. Mr. Druce, a great and successful breeder of the Improved
  Oxfordshires (a crossed race), writes, "without a change of boars of a
  different tribe, but of the same breed, constitution cannot be
  preserved." Mr. Fisher Hobbs, the raiser of the celebrated Improved Essex
  breed, divided his stock into three separate families, by which means he
  maintained the breed for more than twenty years, "by judicious selection
  from the <i>three distinct families</i>."<a name="NtA_261"
  href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> Lord Western was the first importer
  of a Neapolitan boar and sow. "From this pair he bred in-and-in, until
  the breed was in danger of becoming extinct, a sure result (as Mr. Sidney
  remarks) of in-and-in breeding." Lord Western then crossed his Neapolitan
  pigs with the old Essex, and made the first great step towards the
  Improved Essex breed. Here is a more interesting case. Mr. J. Wright,
  well known as a breeder, crossed<a name="NtA_262"
  href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a> the same boar with the daughter,
  granddaughter, and great-granddaughter, and so on for seven generations.
  The result was, that in many instances the offspring failed to breed; in
  others they produced few that lived; and of the latter many were idiotic,
  without sense <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>{122}</span>even to suck, and when attempting to move
  could not walk straight. Now it deserves especial notice, that the two
  last sows produced by this long course of interbreeding were sent to
  other boars, and they bore several litters of healthy pigs. The best sow
  in external appearance produced during the whole seven generations was
  one in the last stage of descent; but the litter consisted of this one
  sow. She would not breed to her sire, yet bred at the first trial to a
  stranger in blood. So that, in Mr. Wright's case, long-continued and
  extremely close interbreeding did not affect the external form or merit
  of the young; but with many of them the general constitution and mental
  powers, and especially the reproductive functions, were seriously
  affected.</p>

  <p>Nathusius gives<a name="NtA_263" href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a>
  an analogous and even more striking case: he imported from England a
  pregnant sow of the large Yorkshire breed, and bred the product closely
  in-and-in for three generations: the result was unfavourable, as the
  young were weak in constitution, with impaired fertility. One of the
  latest sows, which he esteemed a good animal, produced, when paired with
  her own uncle (who was known to be productive with sows of other breeds),
  a litter of six, and a second time a litter of only five weak young pigs.
  He then paired this sow with a boar of a small black breed, which he had
  likewise imported from England, and which boar, when matched with sows of
  his own breed, produced from seven to nine young: now, the sow of the
  large breed, which was so unproductive when paired with her own uncle,
  yielded to the small black boar, in the first litter twenty-one, and in
  the second litter eighteen young pigs; so that in one year she produced
  thirty-nine fine young animals!</p>

  <p>As in the case of several other animals already mentioned, even when
  no injury is perceptible from moderately close interbreeding, yet, to
  quote the words of Mr. Coate, a most successful breeder (who five times
  won the annual gold medal of the Smithfield Club Show for the best pen of
  pigs), "Crosses answer well for profit to the farmer, as you get more
  constitution and quicker growth; but for me, who sell a great number of
  pigs for breeding purposes, I find it will not do, as it requires many
  years to get anything like purity of blood again."<a name="NtA_264"
  href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Before passing on to Birds, I ought to refer to man, though I am
  unwilling to enter on this subject, as it is surrounded by natural
  prejudices. It has moreover been discussed by various authors under many
  points of view.<a name="NtA_265" href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> Mr.
  Tylor<a name="NtA_266" href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a> has shown <!--
  Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>that
  with widely different races, in the most distant quarters of the world,
  marriages between relations&mdash;even between distant
  relations&mdash;have been strictly prohibited. A few exceptional cases
  can be specified, especially with royal families; and these have been
  enlarged on in a learned article<a name="NtA_267"
  href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> by Mr. W. Adam, and formerly in 1828
  by Hofacker. Mr. Tylor is inclined to believe that the almost universal
  prohibition of closely-related marriages has arisen from their evil
  effects having been observed, and he ingeniously explains some apparent
  anomalies in the prohibition not extending equally to the relations on
  both the male and female side. He admits, however, that other causes,
  such as the extension of friendly alliances, may have come into play. Mr.
  W. Adam, on the other hand, concludes that related marriages are
  prohibited and viewed with repugnance from the confusion which would thus
  arise in the descent of property, and from other still more recondite
  reasons; but I cannot accept this view, seeing that the savages of
  Australia and South America,<a name="NtA_268"
  href="#Nt_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> who have no property to bequeath or
  fine moral feelings to confuse, hold the crime of incest in
  abhorrence.</p>

  <p>It would be interesting to know, if it could be ascertained, as
  throwing light on this question with respect to man, what occurs with the
  higher anthropomorphous apes&mdash;whether the young males and females
  soon wander away from their parents, or whether the old males become
  jealous of their sons and expel them, or whether any inherited
  instinctive feeling, from being beneficial, has been generated, leading
  the young males and females of the same family to prefer pairing with
  distinct families, and to dislike pairing with each other. A considerable
  body of evidence has already been advanced, showing that the offspring
  from parents which are not related are more vigorous and fertile than
  those from parents which are closely related; hence any slight feeling,
  arising from the sexual excitement of novelty or other cause, which led
  to the former rather than to the latter unions, would be augmented
  through natural selection, and thus might become instinctive; for those
  individuals which had an innate preference of this kind would increase in
  number. It seems more probable, that degraded savages should <!-- Page
  124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span>thus
  unconsciously have acquired their dislike and even abhorrence of
  incestuous marriages, rather than that they should have discovered by
  reasoning and observation the evil results. The abhorrence occasionally
  failing is no valid argument against the feeling being instinctive, for
  any instinct may occasionally fail or become vitiated, as sometimes
  occurs with parental love and the social sympathies. In the case of man,
  the question whether evil follows from close interbreeding will probably
  never be answered by direct evidence, as he propagates his kind so slowly
  and cannot be subjected to experiment; but the almost universal practice
  of all races at all times of avoiding closely-related marriages is an
  argument of considerable weight; and whatever conclusion we arrive at in
  regard to the higher animals may be safely extended to man.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Turning now to Birds: in the case of the <i>Fowl</i> a whole array of
  authorities could be given against too close interbreeding. Sir J.
  Sebright positively asserts that he made many trials, and that his fowls,
  when thus treated, became long in the legs, small in the body, and bad
  breeders.<a name="NtA_269" href="#Nt_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a> He
  produced the famous Sebright Bantams by complicated crosses, and by
  breeding in-and-in; and since his time there has been much close
  interbreeding with these Bantams; and they are now notoriously bad
  breeders. I have seen Silver Bantams, directly descended from his stock,
  which had become almost as barren as hybrids; for not a single chicken
  had been that year hatched from two full nests of eggs. Mr. Hewitt says
  that with these Bantams the sterility of the male stands, with rare
  exceptions, in the closest relation with their loss of certain secondary
  male characters: he adds, "I have noticed, as a general rule, that even
  the slightest deviation from feminine character in the tail of the male
  Sebright&mdash;say the elongation by only half an inch of the two
  principal tail-feathers&mdash;brings with it improved probability of
  increased fertility."<a name="NtA_270"
  href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Mr. Wright states<a name="NtA_271" href="#Nt_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a>
  that Mr. Clark, "whose fighting-cocks were so notorious, continued to
  breed from his own kind till they lost their disposition to fight, but
  stood to be cut up without making any resistance, and were so reduced in
  size as to be under those weights required for the best prizes; but on
  obtaining a cross from Mr. Leighton, they again resumed their former
  courage and weight." It should be borne in mind that game-cocks before
  they fought were always weighed, so that nothing was left to the
  imagination about any reduction or increase of <!-- Page 125 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span>weight. Mr. Clark does
  not seem to have bred from brothers and sisters, which is the most
  injurious kind of union; and he found, after repeated trials, that there
  was a greater reduction in weight in the young from a father paired with
  his daughter, than from a mother with her son. I may add that Mr. Eyton,
  of Eyton, the well-known ornithologist, who is a large breeder of Grey
  Dorkings, informs me that they certainly diminish in size, and become
  less prolific, unless a cross with another strain is occasionally
  obtained. So it is with Malays, according to Mr. Hewitt, as far as size
  is concerned.<a name="NtA_272" href="#Nt_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

  <p>An experienced writer<a name="NtA_273"
  href="#Nt_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a> remarks that the same amateur, as is
  well known, seldom long maintains the superiority of his birds; and this,
  he adds, undoubtedly is due to all his stock "being of the same blood;"
  hence it is indispensable that he should occasionally procure a bird of
  another strain. But this is not necessary with those who keep a stock of
  fowls at different stations. Thus, Mr. Ballance, who has bred Malays for
  thirty years, and has won more prizes with these birds than any other
  fancier in England, says that breeding in-and-in does not necessarily
  cause deterioration; "but all depends upon how this is managed." "My plan
  has been to keep about five or six distinct runs, and to rear about two
  hundred or three hundred chickens each year, and select the best birds
  from each run for crossing. I thus secure sufficient crossing to prevent
  deterioration."<a name="NtA_274" href="#Nt_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We thus see that there is almost complete unanimity with
  poultry-breeders that, when fowls are kept at the same place, evil
  quickly follows from interbreeding carried on to an extent which would be
  disregarded in the case of most quadrupeds. On the other hand, it is a
  generally received opinion that cross-bred chickens are the hardiest and
  most easily reared.<a name="NtA_275" href="#Nt_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a>
  Mr. Tegetmeier, who has carefully attended to poultry of all breeds,
  says<a name="NtA_276" href="#Nt_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a> that Dorking
  hens, allowed to run with Houdan or Crevec&oelig;ur cocks, "produce in
  the early spring chickens that for size, hardihood, early maturity, and
  fitness for the market, surpass those of any pure breed that we have ever
  raised." Mr. Hewitt gives it as a general rule with fowls, that crossing
  the breed increases their size. He makes this remark after stating that
  hybrids from the pheasant and fowl are considerably larger than either
  progenitor: so again, hybrids from the male golden pheasant and hen
  common pheasant "are of far larger size than either parent-bird."<a
  name="NtA_277" href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> To this subject of the
  increased size of hybrids I shall presently return.</p>

  <p>With <i>Pigeons</i>, breeders are unanimous, as previously stated,
  that it is absolutely indispensable, notwithstanding the trouble and
  expense thus caused, occasionally to cross their much-prized birds with
  individuals of another strain, but belonging, of course, to the same
  variety. It deserves <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>notice that, when large size is one of the
  desired characters, as with pouters,<a name="NtA_278"
  href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a> the evil effects of close
  interbreeding are much sooner perceived than when small birds, such as
  short-faced tumblers, are valued. The extreme delicacy of the high fancy
  breeds, such as these tumblers and improved English carriers, is
  remarkable; they are liable to many diseases, and often die in the egg or
  during the first moult; and their eggs have generally to be hatched under
  foster-mothers. Although these highly-prized birds have invariably been
  subjected to much close interbreeding, yet their extreme delicacy of
  constitution cannot perhaps be thus fully explained. Mr. Yarrell informed
  me that Sir J. Sebright continued closely interbreeding some owl-pigeons,
  until from their extreme sterility he as nearly as possible lost the
  whole family. Mr. Brent<a name="NtA_279"
  href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> tried to raise a breed of trumpeters,
  by crossing a common pigeon, and recrossing the daughter, granddaughter,
  great-granddaughter, and great-great-granddaughter, with the same male
  trumpeter, until he obtained a bird with <sup>15</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths
  of trumpeter's blood; but then the experiment failed, for "breeding so
  close stopped reproduction." The experienced Neumeister<a name="NtA_280"
  href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> also asserts that the offspring from
  dovecotes and various other breeds are "generally very fertile and hardy
  birds:" so again, MM. Boitard and Corbié,<a name="NtA_281"
  href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> after forty-five years' experience,
  recommend persons to cross their breeds for amusement; for, if they fail
  to make interesting birds, they will succeed under an economical point of
  view, "as it is found that mongrels are more fertile than pigeons of pure
  race."</p>

  <p>I will refer only to one other animal, namely, the Hive-bee, because a
  distinguished entomologist has advanced this as a case of inevitable
  close interbreeding. As the hive is tenanted by a single female, it might
  have been thought that her male and female offspring would always have
  bred together, more especially as bees of different hives are hostile to
  each other; a strange worker being almost always attacked when trying to
  enter another hive. But Mr. Tegetmeier has shown<a name="NtA_282"
  href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a> that this instinct does not apply to
  drones, which are permitted to enter any hive; so that there is no <i>à
  priori</i> improbability of a queen receiving a foreign drone. The fact
  of the union invariably and necessarily taking place on the wing, during
  the queen's nuptial flight, seems to be a special provision against
  continued interbreeding. However this may be, experience has shown, since
  the introduction of the yellow-banded Ligurian race into Germany and
  England, that bees freely cross: Mr. Woodbury, who introduced Ligurian
  bees into Devonshire, found during a single season that three stocks, at
  distances of from one to two miles from his hives, were crossed by his
  drones. In one case the Ligurian drones must have flown over the city of
  Exeter, and over several intermediate hives. On another occasion several
  common black queens were crossed by Ligurian drones at a distance of from
  one to three and a half miles.<a name="NtA_283"

<p class="cenhead"><i>Plants.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>When a single plant of a new species is introduced into any country,
  if propagated by seed, many individuals will soon be raised, so that if
  the proper insects be present there will be crossing. With
  newly-introduced trees or other plants not propagated by seed we are not
  here concerned. With old-established plants it is an almost universal
  practice occasionally to make exchanges of seed, by which means
  individuals which have been exposed to different conditions of
  life,&mdash;and this, as we have seen, diminishes the evil from close
  interbreeding,&mdash;will occasionally be introduced into each
  district.</p>

  <p>Experiments have not been tried on the effects of fertilising flowers
  with their own pollen during <i>several</i> generations. But we shall
  presently see that certain plants, either normally or abnormally, are
  more or less sterile, even in the first generation, when fertilised by
  their own pollen. Although nothing is directly known on the evil effects
  of long-continued close interbreeding with plants, the converse
  proposition that great good is derived from crossing is well
  established.</p>

  <p>With respect to the crossing of individuals belonging to the same
  sub-variety, Gärtner, whose accuracy and experience exceeded that of all
  other hybridisers, states<a name="NtA_284"
  href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a> that he has many times observed good
  effects from this step, especially with exotic genera, of which the
  fertility is somewhat impaired, such as Passiflora, Lobelia, and Fuchsia.
  Herbert also says,<a name="NtA_285" href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a>
  "I am inclined to think that I have derived advantage from impregnating
  the flower from which I wished to obtain seed with pollen from another
  individual of the same variety, or at least from another flower, rather
  than with its own." Again, Professor Lecoq asserts that he has
  ascertained that crossed offspring are more vigorous and robust than
  their parents.<a name="NtA_286" href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

  <p>General statements of this kind, however, can seldom be fully trusted;
  consequently I have begun a series of experiments, which, if they
  continue to give the same results as hitherto, will for ever settle the
  question of the good effects of crossing two distinct plants of the same
  variety, and of the evil effects of self-fertilisation. A clear light
  will thus also be thrown on the fact that flowers are invariably
  constructed so as to permit, or favour, or necessitate the union of two
  individuals. We shall clearly understand why mon&oelig;cious and
  di&oelig;cious,&mdash;why dimorphic and trimorphic plants exist, and many
  other such cases. The plan which I have followed in my experiments is to
  grow plants in the same pot, or in pots of the same size, or close
  together in the open ground; to carefully exclude insects; and then to
  fertilise some of the flowers with pollen from the same flower, and
  others on the same plant with pollen from a distinct but adjoining plant.
  In many, but not all, of these experiments, the crossed plants yielded
  much more seed than the self-fertilised plants; and I have never seen the
  <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>{128}</span>reversed case. The self-fertilised and
  crossed seeds thus obtained were allowed to germinate in the same glass
  vessel on damp sand; and as the seeds successively germinated, they were
  planted in pairs on opposite sides of the same pot, with a superficial
  partition between them, and were placed so as to be equally exposed to
  the light. In other cases the self-fertilised and crossed seeds were
  simply sown on opposite sides of the same small pot. I have, in short,
  followed different plans, but in every case have taken all the
  precautions which I could think of, so that the two lots should be
  equally favoured. Now, I have carefully observed the growth of plants
  raised from crossed and self-fertilised seed, from their germination to
  maturity, in species of the following genera, namely, Brassica, Lathyrus,
  Lupinus, Lobelia, Lactuca, Dianthus, Myosotis, Petunia, Linaria,
  Calceolaria, Mimulus, and Ipom&oelig;a, and the difference in their
  powers of growth, and of withstanding in certain cases unfavourable
  conditions, was most manifest and strongly marked. It is of importance
  that the two lots of seed should be sown or planted on opposite sides of
  the same pot, so that the seedlings may struggle against each other; for
  if sown separately in ample and good soil, there is often but little
  difference in their growth.</p>

  <p>I will briefly describe the two most striking cases as yet observed by
  me. Six crossed and six self-fertilised seeds of <i>Ipom&oelig;a
  purpurea</i>, from plants treated in the manner above described, were
  planted as soon as they had germinated, in pairs on opposite sides of two
  pots, and rods of equal thickness were given them to twine up. Five of
  the crossed plants grew from the first more quickly than the opposed
  self-fertilised plants; the sixth, however, was weakly and was for a time
  beaten, but at last its sounder constitution prevailed and it shot ahead
  of its antagonist. As soon as each crossed plant reached the top of its
  seven-foot rod its fellow was measured, and the result was that, when the
  crossed plants were seven feet high, the self-fertilised had attained the
  average height of only five feet four and a half inches. The crossed
  plants flowered a little before, and more profusely than the
  self-fertilised plants. On opposite sides of another <i>small</i> pot a
  large number of crossed and self-fertilised seeds were sown, so that they
  had to struggle for bare existence; a single rod was given to each lot:
  here again the crossed plants showed from the first their advantage; they
  never quite reached the summit of the seven-foot rod, but relatively to
  the self-fertilised plants their average height was as seven feet to five
  feet two inches. The experiment was repeated in the two following
  generations with plants raised from the self-fertilised and crossed
  plants, treated in exactly the same manner, and with nearly the same
  result. In the second generation, the crossed plants, which were again
  crossed, produced 121 seed-capsules, whilst the self-fertilised plants,
  again self-fertilised, produced only 84 capsules.</p>

  <p>Some flowers of the <i>Mimulus luteus</i> were fertilised with their
  own pollen, and others were crossed with pollen from distinct plants
  growing in the same pot. The seeds after germinating were thickly planted
  on opposite sides of a pot. The seedlings were at first equal in height;
  but when the young crossed plants were exactly half an inch, the <!--
  Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span>self-fertilised plants were only a quarter
  of an inch high. But this inequality did not continue, for, when the
  crossed plants were four and a half inches high, the self-fertilised were
  three inches; and they retained the same relative difference till their
  growth was complete. The crossed plants looked far more vigorous than the
  uncrossed, and flowered before them; they produced also a far greater
  number of flowers, which yielded capsules (judging, however, from only a
  few) containing more seeds. As in the former case, the experiment was
  repeated in the same manner during the next two generations, and with
  exactly the same result. Had I not watched these plants of the Mimulus
  and Ipom&oelig;a during their whole growth, I could not have believed it
  possible, that a difference apparently so slight, as that of the pollen
  being taken from the same flower, and from a distinct plant growing in
  the same small pot, could have made so wonderful a difference in the
  growth and vigour of the plants thus produced. This, under a
  physiological point of view, is a most remarkable phenomenon.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>With respect to the benefit derived from crossing distinct varieties,
  plenty of evidence has been published. Sageret<a name="NtA_287"
  href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> repeatedly speaks in strong terms of
  the vigour of melons raised by crossing different varieties, and adds
  that they are more easily fertilised than common melons, and produce
  numerous good seed. Here follows the evidence of an English gardener:<a
  name="NtA_288" href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> "I have this summer
  met with better success in my cultivation of melons, in an unprotected
  state, from the seeds of hybrids (<i>i.e.</i> mongrels) obtained by cross
  impregnation, than with old varieties. The offspring of three different
  hybridisations (one more especially, of which the parents were the two
  most dissimilar varieties I could select) each yielded more ample and
  finer produce than any one of between twenty and thirty established
  varieties."</p>

  <p>Andrew Knight<a name="NtA_289" href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a>
  believed that his seedlings from crossed varieties of the apple exhibited
  increased vigour and luxuriance; and M. Chevreul<a name="NtA_290"
  href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> alludes to the extreme vigour of some
  of the crossed fruit-trees raised by Sageret.</p>

  <p>By crossing reciprocally the tallest and shortest peas, Knight<a
  name="NtA_291" href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> says, "I had in this
  experiment a striking instance of the stimulative effects of crossing the
  breeds; for the smallest variety, whose height rarely exceeded two feet,
  was increased to six feet; whilst the height of the large and luxuriant
  kind was very little diminished." Mr. Laxton gave me seed-peas produced
  from crosses between four distinct kinds; and the plants thus raised were
  extraordinarily vigorous, being in each case from one to two or three
  feet taller than the parent-forms growing close alongside them.</p>

<p><!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>{130}</span></p>

  <p>Wiegmann<a name="NtA_292" href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> made
  many crosses between several varieties of cabbage; and he speaks with
  astonishment of the vigour and height of the mongrels, which excited the
  amazement of all the gardeners who beheld them. Mr. Chaundy raised a
  great number of mongrels by planting together six distinct varieties of
  cabbage. These mongrels displayed an infinite diversity of character;
  "But the most remarkable circumstance was, that, while all the other
  cabbages and borecoles in the nursery were destroyed by a severe winter,
  these hybrids were little injured, and supplied the kitchen when there
  was no other cabbage to be had."</p>

  <p>Mr. Maund exhibited before the Royal Agricultural Society<a
  name="NtA_293" href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a> specimens of crossed
  wheat, together with their parent varieties; and the editor states that
  they were intermediate in character, "united with that greater vigour of
  growth, which it appears, in the vegetable as in the animal world, is the
  result of a first cross." Knight also crossed several varieties of
  wheat,<a name="NtA_294" href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> and he says
  "that in the years 1795 and 1796, when almost the whole crop of corn in
  the island was blighted, the varieties thus obtained, and these only,
  escaped in this neighbourhood, though sown in several different soils and
  situations."</p>

  <p>Here is a remarkable case: M. Clotzsch<a name="NtA_295"
  href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> crossed <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> and
  <i>nigricans</i>, <i>Quercus robur</i> and <i>pedunculata, Alnus
  glutinosa</i> and <i>incana</i>, <i>Ulmus campestris</i> and
  <i>effusa</i>; and the cross-fertilised seeds, as well as seeds of the
  pure parent-trees, were all sown at the same time and in the same place.
  The result was, that after an interval of eight years, the hybrids were
  one-third taller than the pure trees!</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The facts above given refer to undoubted varieties, excepting the
  trees crossed by Clotzsch, which are ranked by various botanists as
  strongly-marked races, sub-species, or species. That true hybrids raised
  from entirely distinct species, though they lose in fertility, often gain
  in size and constitutional vigour, is certain. It would be superfluous to
  quote any facts; for all experimenters, Kölreuter, Gärtner, Herbert,
  Sageret, Lecoq, and Naudin, have been struck with the wonderful vigour,
  height, size, tenacity of life, precocity, and hardiness of their hybrid
  productions. Gärtner<a name="NtA_296" href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a>
  sums up his conviction on this head in the strongest terms. Kölreuter<a
  name="NtA_297" href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> gives numerous precise
  measurements of the weight and height of his hybrids in comparison with
  measurements of both parent-forms; and speaks with astonishment of their
  "<i>statura portentosa</i>," their "<i>ambitus vastissimus ac altitudo
  valde conspicua</i>." Some exceptions to the rule in the case of very
  sterile hybrids have, however, been noticed by Gärtner and <!-- Page 131
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span>Herbert; but
  the most striking exceptions are given by Max Wichura,<a name="NtA_298"
  href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> who found that hybrid willows were
  generally tender in constitution, dwarf, and short-lived.</p>

  <p>Kölreuter explains the vast increase in the size of the roots, stems,
  &amp;c., of his hybrids, as the result of a sort of compensation due to
  their sterility, in the same way as many emasculated animals are larger
  than the perfect males. This view seems at first sight extremely
  probable, and has been accepted by various authors;<a name="NtA_299"
  href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> but Gärtner<a name="NtA_300"
  href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> has well remarked that there is much
  difficulty in fully admitting it; for with many hybrids there is no
  parallelism between the degree of their sterility and their increased
  size and vigour. The most striking instances of luxuriant growth have
  been observed with hybrids which were not sterile in any extreme degree.
  In the genus Mirabilis, certain hybrids are unusually fertile, and their
  extraordinary luxuriance of growth, together with their enormous roots,<a
  name="NtA_301" href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> have been transmitted
  to their progeny. The increased size of the hybrids produced between the
  fowl and pheasant, and between the distinct species of pheasants, has
  been already noticed. The result in all cases is probably in part due to
  the saving of nutriment and vital force through the sexual organs not
  acting, or acting imperfectly, but more especially to the general law of
  good being derived from a cross. For it deserves especial attention that
  mongrel animals and plants, which are so far from being sterile that
  their fertility is often actually augmented, have, as previously shown,
  their size, hardiness, and constitutional vigour generally increased. It
  is not a little remarkable that an accession of vigour and size should
  thus arise under the opposite contingencies of increased and diminished
  fertility.</p>

  <p>It is a perfectly well ascertained fact<a name="NtA_302"
  href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> that hybrids will invariably breed
  more readily with either pure parent, and not rarely with a distinct
  species, than with each other. Herbert is inclined to explain even this
  fact by the advantage derived from a cross; but Gärtner more justly
  accounts for it by the pollen of the hybrid, and probably its ovules,
  being in some degree vitiated, whereas the pollen and ovules of both pure
  parents and of any third species are sound. Nevertheless there are some
  well-ascertained and remarkable facts, which, as we shall immediately
  see, show that the act of crossing in itself undoubtedly tends to
  increase or re-establish the fertility of hybrids.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>On certain Hermaphrodite Plants which, either normally or abnormally,
require to be fertilised by pollen from a distinct individual
or species.</i></p>

  <p>The facts now to be given differ from those hitherto detailed, as the
  self-sterility does not here result from long-continued, <!-- Page 132
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>close
  interbreeding. These facts are, however, connected with our present
  subject, because a cross with a distinct individual is shown to be either
  necessary or advantageous. Dimorphic and trimorphic plants, though they
  are hermaphrodites, must be reciprocally crossed, one set of forms by the
  other, in order to be fully fertile, and in some cases to be fertile in
  any degree. But I should not have noticed these plants, had it not been
  for the following cases given by Dr. Hildebrand:<a name="NtA_303"
  href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>Primula sinensis</i> is a reciprocally dimorphic species: Dr.
  Hildebrand fertilised twenty-eight flowers of both forms, each by pollen
  of the other form, and obtained the full number of capsules containing on
  an average 42.7 seed per capsule; here we have complete and normal
  fertility. He then fertilised forty-two flowers of both forms with pollen
  of the same form, but taken from a distinct plant, and all produced
  capsules containing on an average only 19.6 seed. Lastly, and here we
  come to our more immediate point, he fertilised forty-eight flowers of
  both forms with pollen of the same form, taken from the same flower, and
  now he obtained only thirty-two capsules, and these contained on an
  average 18.6 seed, or one less per capsule than in the former case. So
  that, with these illegitimate unions, the act of impregnation is less
  assured, and the fertility slightly less, when the pollen and ovules
  belong to the same flower, than when belonging to two distinct
  individuals of the same form. Dr. Hildebrand has recently made analogous
  experiments on the long-styled form of <i>Oxalis rosea</i>, with the same
  result.<a name="NtA_304" href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It has recently been discovered that certain plants, whilst growing in
  their native country under natural conditions, cannot be fertilised with
  pollen from the same plant. They are sometimes so utterly self-impotent,
  that, though they can readily be fertilised by the pollen of a distinct
  species or even distinct genus, yet, wonderful as the fact is, they never
  produce a single seed by their own pollen. In some cases, moreover, the
  plant's own pollen and stigma mutually act on each other in a deleterious
  manner. Most of the facts to be given relate to Orchids, but I will
  commence with a plant belonging to a widely different family.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Sixty-three flowers of <i>Corydalis cava</i>, borne on distinct
  plants, were fertilised by Dr. Hildebrand<a name="NtA_305"
  href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> with pollen from other plants of the
  same species; and fifty-eight capsules were obtained, including on an
  average <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page133"></a>{133}</span>4.5 seed in each. He then fertilised
  sixteen flowers produced by the same raceme, one with another, but
  obtained only three capsules, one of which alone contained any good
  seeds, namely, two in number. Lastly, he fertilised twenty-seven flowers,
  each with its own pollen; he left also fifty-seven flowers to be
  spontaneously fertilised, and this would certainly have ensued if it had
  been possible, for the anthers not only touch the stigma, but the
  pollen-tubes were seen by Dr. Hildebrand to penetrate it; nevertheless
  these eighty-four flowers did not produce a single seed-capsule! This
  whole case is highly instructive, as it shows how widely different the
  action of the same pollen is, according as it is placed on the stigma of
  the same flower, or on that of another flower on the same raceme, or on
  that of a distinct plant.</p>

  <p>With exotic Orchids several analogous cases have been observed,
  chiefly by Mr. John Scott.<a name="NtA_306"
  href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> <i>Oncidium sphacelatum</i> has
  effective pollen, for with it Mr. Scott fertilised two distinct species;
  its ovules are likewise capable of impregnation, for they were readily
  fertilised by the pollen of <i>O. divaricatum</i>; nevertheless, between
  one and two hundred flowers fertilised by their own pollen did not
  produce a single capsule, though the stigmas were penetrated by the
  pollen-tubes. Mr. Robinson Munro, of the Royal Botanic Gardens of
  Edinburgh, also informs me (1864) that a hundred and twenty flowers of
  this same species were fertilised by him with their own pollen, and did
  not produce a capsule, but eight flowers fertilised by the pollen of
  <i>O. divaricatum</i> produced four fine capsules: again, between two and
  three hundred flowers of <i>O. divaricatum</i>, fertilised by their own
  pollen, did not set a capsule, but twelve flowers fertilised by <i>O.
  flexuosum</i> produced eight fine capsules: so that here we have three
  utterly self-impotent species, with their male and female organs perfect,
  as shown by their mutual fertilisation. In these cases fertilisation was
  effected only by the aid of a distinct species. But, as we shall
  presently see, distinct plants, raised from seed, of <i>Oncidium
  flexuosum</i>, and probably of the other species, would have been
  perfectly capable of fertilising each other, for this is the natural
  process. Again, Mr. Scott found that the pollen of a plant of <i>O.
  microchilum</i> was good, for with it he fertilised two distinct species;
  he found its ovules good, for they could be fertilised by the pollen of
  one of these species, and by the pollen of a distinct plant of <i>O.
  microchilum</i>; but they could not be fertilised by pollen of the same
  plant, though the pollen-tubes penetrated the stigma. An analogous case
  has been recorded by M. Rivière,<a name="NtA_307"
  href="#Nt_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a> with two plants of <i>O.
  Cavendishianum</i>, which were both self-sterile, but reciprocally
  fertilised each other. All these cases refer to the genus Oncidium, but
  Mr. Scott found that <i>Maxillaria atro-rubens</i> was "totally
  insusceptible of fertilisation with its own pollen," but fertilised, and
  was fertilised by, a widely distinct species, viz. <i>M.
  squalens</i>.</p>

  <p>As these orchids had grown under unnatural conditions, in <!-- Page
  134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>hot-houses, I concluded without hesitation
  that their self-sterility was due to this cause. But Fritz Müller informs
  me that at Desterro, in Brazil, he fertilised above one hundred flowers
  of the above-mentioned <i>Oncidium flexuosum</i>, which is there endemic,
  with its own pollen, and with that taken from distinct plants; all the
  former were sterile, whilst those fertilised by pollen from any <i>other
  plant</i> of the same species were fertile. During the first three days
  there was no difference in the action of the two kinds of pollen: that
  placed on the stigma of the same plant separated in the usual manner into
  grains, and emitted tubes which penetrated the column, and the stigmatic
  chamber shut itself; but the flowers alone which had been fertilised by
  pollen taken from a distinct plant produced seed-capsules. On a
  subsequent occasion these experiments were repeated on a large scale with
  the same result. Fritz Müller found that four other endemic species of
  Oncidium were in like manner utterly sterile with their own pollen, but
  fertile with that from any other plant: some of them likewise produced
  seed-capsules when impregnated with pollen of widely distinct genera,
  such as Leptotes, Cyrtopodium, and Rodriguezia! <i>Oncidium crispum</i>,
  however, differs from the foregoing species in varying much in its
  self-sterility; some plants producing fine pods with their own pollen,
  others failing to do so; in two or three instances, Fritz Müller observed
  that the pods produced by pollen taken from a distinct flower on the same
  plant, were larger than those produced by the flower's own pollen. In
  <i>Epidendrum cinnabarinum</i>, an orchid belonging to another division
  of the family, fine pods were produced by the plant's own pollen, but
  they contained by weight only about half as much seed as the capsules
  which had been fertilized by pollen from a distinct plant, and in one
  instance from a distinct species; moreover, a very large proportion, and
  in some cases nearly all the seed produced by the plant's own pollen, was
  embryonless and worthless. Some self-fertilized capsules of a Maxillaria
  were in a similar state.</p>

  <p>Another observation made by Fritz Müller is highly remarkable, namely,
  that with various orchids the plant's own pollen not only fails to
  impregnate the flower, but acts on the stigma, and is acted on, in an
  injurious or poisonous manner. This is shown by the surface of the stigma
  in contact with the pollen, and by the pollen itself, becoming in from
  three to five days dark brown, and then decaying. The discolouration and
  decay are not caused by parasitic cryptogams, which were observed by
  Fritz Müller in only a single instance. These changes are well shown by
  placing on the same stigma, at the same time, the plant's own pollen and
  that from a distinct plant of the same species, or of another species, or
  even of another and widely remote genus. Thus, on the stigma of
  <i>Oncidium flexuosum</i>, the plant's own pollen and that from a
  distinct plant were placed side by side, and in five days' time the
  latter was perfectly fresh, whilst the plant's own pollen was brown. On
  the other hand, when the pollen of a distinct plant of the <i>Oncidium
  flexuosum</i>, and of the <i>Epidendrum zebra</i> (<i>nov. spec.?</i>),
  were placed together on the same stigma, they behaved in exactly the same
  manner, the grains separating, emitting tubes, and penetrating the
  stigma, so that the two <!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page135"></a>{135}</span>pollen-masses, after an interval of eleven
  days, could not be distinguished except by the difference of their
  caudicles, which, of course, undergo no change. Fritz Müller has,
  moreover, made a large number of crosses between orchids belonging to
  distinct species and genera, and he finds that in all cases when the
  flowers are not fertilised their footstalks first begin to wither; and
  the withering slowly spreads upwards until the germens fall off, after an
  interval of one or two weeks, and in one instance of between six and
  seven weeks; but even in this latter case, and in most other cases, the
  pollen and stigma remained in appearance fresh. Occasionally, however,
  the pollen becomes brownish, generally on the external surface, and not
  in contact with the stigma, as is invariably the case when the plant's
  own pollen is applied.</p>

  <p>Fritz Müller observed the poisonous action of the plant's own pollen
  in the above-mentioned <i>Oncidium flexuosum</i>, <i>O. unicorne,
  pubes</i> (<i>?</i>), and in two other unnamed species. Also in two
  species of Rodriguezia, in two of Notylia, in one of Burlingtonia, and of
  a fourth genus in the same group. In all these cases, except the last, it
  was proved that the flowers were, as might have been expected, fertile
  with pollen from a distinct plant of the same species. Numerous flowers
  of one species of Notylia were fertilized with pollen from the same
  raceme; in two days' time they all withered, the germens began to shrink,
  the pollen-masses became dark brown, and not one pollen-grain emitted a
  tube. So that in this orchid the injurious action of the plant's own
  pollen is more rapid than with <i>Oncidium flexuosum</i>. Eight other
  flowers on the same raceme were fertilized with pollen from a distinct
  plant of the same species: two of these were dissected, and their stigmas
  were found to be penetrated by numberless pollen-tubes; and the germens
  of the other six flowers became well developed. On a subsequent occasion
  many other flowers were fertilized with their own pollen, and all fell
  off dead in a few days; whilst some flowers on the same raceme which had
  been left simply unfertilised adhered and long remained fresh. We have
  seen that in cross-unions between extremely distinct orchids the pollen
  long remains undecayed; but Notylia behaved in this respect differently;
  for when its pollen was placed on the stigma of <i>Oncidium
  flexuosum</i>, both the stigma and pollen quickly became dark brown, in
  the same manner as if the plant's own pollen had been applied.</p>

  <p>Fritz Müller suggests that, as in all these cases the plant's own
  pollen is not only impotent (thus effectually preventing
  self-fertilization), but likewise prevents, as was ascertained in the
  case of the Notylia and <i>Oncidium flexuosum</i>, the action of
  subsequently applied pollen from a distinct individual, it would be an
  advantage to the plant to have its own pollen rendered more and more
  deleterious; for the germens would thus quickly be killed, and, dropping
  off, there would be no further waste in nourishing a part which
  ultimately could be of no avail. Fritz Müller's discovery that a plant's
  own pollen and stigma in some cases act on each other as if mutually
  poisonous, is certainly most remarkable.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We now come to cases closely analogous with those just <!-- Page 136
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>given, but
  different, inasmuch as individual plants alone of the species are
  self-impotent. This self-impotence does not depend on the pollen or
  ovules being in a state unfit for fertilisation, for both have been found
  effective in union with other plants of the same or of a distinct
  species. The fact of these plants having spontaneously acquired so
  peculiar a constitution, that they can be fertilised more readily by the
  pollen of a distinct species than by their own, is remarkable. These
  abnormal cases, as well as the foregoing normal cases, in which certain
  orchids, for instance, can be much more easily fertilised by the pollen
  of a distinct species than by their own, are exactly the reverse of what
  occurs with all ordinary species. For in these latter the two sexual
  elements of the same individual plant are capable of freely acting on
  each other; but are so constituted that they are more or less impotent
  when brought into union with the sexual elements of a distinct species,
  and produce more or less sterile hybrids. It would appear that the pollen
  or ovules, or both, of the individual plants which are in this abnormal
  state, have been affected in some strange manner by the conditions to
  which they themselves or their parents have been exposed; but whilst thus
  rendered self-sterile, they have retained the capacity common to most
  species of partially fertilizing and being partially fertilized by allied
  forms. However this may be, the subject, to a certain extent, is related
  to our general conclusion that good is derived from the act of
  crossing.</p>

  <p>Gärtner experimented on two plants of <i>Lobelia fulgens</i>, brought

  these same two species; but these two plants of <i>L. fulgens</i> could
  not be fertilised by their own pollen, as can generally be effected with
  perfect ease with this species. Again, the pollen of a plant of
  <i>Verbascum nigrum</i> grown in a pot was found by Gärtner<a

  <i>V. lychnitis</i> and <i>V. Austriacum</i>; the ovules could be

  be fertilised by their own pollen. Kölreuter, also,<a name="NtA_310"
  href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> gives the case of three <!-- Page 137
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span>garden plants
  of <i>Verbascum ph&oelig;niceum</i>, which bore during two years many
  flowers; these he successfully fertilised by the pollen of no less than
  four distinct species, but they produced not a seed with their own
  apparently good pollen; subsequently these same plants, and others raised
  from seed, assumed a strangely fluctuating condition, being temporarily
  sterile on the male or female side, or on both sides, and sometimes
  fertile on both sides; but two of the plants were perfectly fertile
  throughout the summer.</p>

  <p>It appears<a name="NtA_311" href="#Nt_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> that
  certain flowers on certain plants of <i>Lilium candidum</i> can be
  fertilised more easily by pollen from a distinct individual than by their
  own. So, again, with the varieties of the potato. Tinzmann,<a
  name="NtA_312" href="#Nt_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> who made many trials
  with this plant, says that pollen from another variety sometimes "exerts
  a powerful influence, and I have found sorts of potatoes which would not
  bear seed from impregnation with the pollen of their own flowers, would
  bear it when impregnated with other pollen." It does not, however, appear
  to have been proved that the pollen which failed to act on the flower's
  own stigma was in itself good.</p>

  <p>In the genus Passiflora it has long been known that several species do
  not produce fruit, unless fertilised by pollen taken from distinct
  species: thus, Mr. Mowbray<a name="NtA_313"
  href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a> found that he could not get fruit
  from <i>P. alata</i> and <i>racemosa</i> except by reciprocally
  fertilising them with each other's pollen. Similar facts have been
  observed in Germany and France;<a name="NtA_314"
  href="#Nt_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a> and I have received two authentic
  accounts of <i>P. quadrangularis</i>, which never produced fruit with its
  own pollen, but would do so freely when fertilised in one case with the
  pollen of <i>P. c&oelig;rulea</i>, and in another case with that of <i>P.
  edulis</i>. So again, with respect to <i>P. laurifolia</i>, a cultivator
  of much experience has recently remarked<a name="NtA_315"
  href="#Nt_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> that the flowers "must be fertilised
  with the pollen of <i>P. c&oelig;rulea</i>, or of some other common kind,
  as their own pollen will not fertilise them." But the fullest details on
  this subject have been given by Mr. Scott:<a name="NtA_316"
  href="#Nt_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a> plants of <i>Passiflora racemosa</i>,
  <i>c&oelig;rulea</i>, and <i>alata</i> flowered profusely during many
  years in the Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh, and, though repeatedly
  fertilised by Mr. Scott and by others with their own pollen, never
  produced any seed; yet this occurred at once with all three species when
  they were crossed together in various ways. But in the case of <i>P.
  c&oelig;rulea</i>, three plants, two of which grew in the Botanic
  Gardens, were all rendered fertile, merely by impregnating the one with
  pollen of the other. The same result was attained in the same manner with
  <i>P. alata</i>, but only with one plant out of three. As so many
  self-sterile species have been mentioned, it may be stated that in the
  case of <i>P. gracilis</i>, which is an annual, the flowers are nearly as
  fertile with their own pollen as with that from a distinct plant; thus
  sixteen flowers <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page138"></a>{138}</span>spontaneously self-fertilised produced
  fruit, each containing on an average 21.3 seed, whilst fruit from
  fourteen crossed flowers contained 24.1 seed.</p>

  <p>Returning to <i>P. alata</i>, I have received (1866) some interesting
  details from Mr. Robinson Munro. Three plants, including one in England,
  have already been mentioned which were inveterately self-sterile, and Mr.
  Munro informs me of several others which, after repeated trials during
  many years, have been found in the same predicament. At some other
  places, however, this species fruits readily when fertilised with its own
  pollen. At Taymouth Castle there is a plant which was formerly grafted by
  Mr. Donaldson on a distinct species, name unknown, and ever since the
  operation it has produced fruit in abundance by its own pollen; so that
  this small and unnatural change in the state of this plant has restored
  its self-fertility! Some of the seedlings from the Taymouth Castle plant
  were found to be not only sterile with their own pollen, but with each
  other's pollen, and with the pollen of distinct species. Pollen from the
  Taymouth plant failed to fertilise certain plants of the same species,
  but was successful on one plant in the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens.
  Seedlings were raised from this latter union, and some of their flowers
  were fertilised by Mr. Munro with their own pollen; but they were found
  to be as self-impotent as the mother-plant had always proved, except when
  fertilised by the grafted Taymouth plant, and except, as we shall see,
  when fertilised by her own seedlings. For Mr. Munro fertilised eighteen
  flowers on the self-impotent mother-plant with pollen from these her own
  self-impotent seedlings, and obtained, remarkable as the fact is,
  eighteen fine capsules full of excellent seed! I have met with no case in
  regard to plants which shows so well as this of <i>P. alata</i>, on what
  small and mysterious causes complete fertility or complete sterility
  depends.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The facts hitherto given relate to the much-lessened or completely
  destroyed fertility of pure species when impregnated with their own
  pollen, in comparison with their fertility when impregnated by distinct
  individuals or distinct species; but closely analogous facts have been
  observed with hybrids.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Herbert states<a name="NtA_317" href="#Nt_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a>
  that having in flower at the same time nine hybrid Hippeastrums, of
  complicated origin, descended from several species, he found that "almost
  every flower touched with pollen from another cross produced seed
  abundantly, and those which were touched with their own pollen either
  failed entirely, or formed slowly a pod of inferior size, with fewer
  seeds." In the 'Horticultural Journal' he adds that, "the admission of
  the pollen of another cross-bred Hippeastrum (however complicated the
  cross) to any <i>one</i> flower of the number, is almost sure to check
  the fructification of the others." In a letter written to me in 1839, Dr.
  Herbert says that he had already tried these experiments during five
  consecutive years, and he subsequently repeated them, with the same
  invariable result. <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page139"></a>{139}</span>He was thus led to make an analogous trial
  on a pure species, namely, on the <i>Hippeastrum aulicum</i>, which he
  had lately imported from Brazil: this bulb produced four flowers, three
  of which were fertilised by their own pollen, and the fourth by the
  pollen of a triple cross between <i>H. bulbulosum</i>, <i>reginæ</i>, and
  <i>vittatum</i>; the result was, that "the ovaries of the three first
  flowers soon ceased to grow, and after a few days perished entirely:
  whereas the pod impregnated by the hybrid made vigorous and rapid
  progress to maturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely." This
  is, indeed, as Herbert remarks, "a strange truth," but not so strange as
  it then appeared.</p>

  <p>As a confirmation of these statements, I may add that Mr. M. Mayes,<a
  name="NtA_318" href="#Nt_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> after much experience
  in crossing the species of Amaryllis (Hippeastrum), says, "neither the
  species nor the hybrids will, we are well aware, produce seed so
  abundantly from their own pollen as from that of others." So, again, Mr.
  Bidwell, in New South Wales,<a name="NtA_319"
  href="#Nt_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> asserts that <i>Amaryllis
  belladonna</i> bears many more seeds when fertilised by the pollen of
  <i>Brunswigia</i> (<i>Amaryllis</i> of some authors) <i>Josephinæ</i> or
  of <i>B. multiflora</i>, than when fertilised by its own pollen. Mr.
  Beaton dusted four flowers of a Cyrtanthus with their own pollen, and
  four with the pollen of <i>Vallota</i> (<i>Amaryllis</i>)
  <i>purpurea</i>; on the seventh day "those which received their own
  pollen slackened their growth, and ultimately perished; those which were
  crossed with the Vallota held on."<a name="NtA_320"
  href="#Nt_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> These latter cases, however, relate
  to uncrossed species, like those before given with respect to Passiflora,
  Orchids, &amp;c., and are here referred to only because the plants belong
  to the same group of Amaryllidaceæ.</p>

  <p>In the experiments on the hybrid Hippeastrums, if Herbert had found
  that the pollen of two or three kinds alone had been more efficient on
  certain kinds than their own pollen, it might have been argued that
  these, from their mixed parentage, had a closer mutual affinity than the
  others; but this explanation is inadmissible, for the trials were made
  reciprocally backwards and forwards on nine different hybrids; and a
  cross, whichever way taken, always proved highly beneficial. I can add a
  striking and analogous case from experiments made by the Rev. A. Rawson,
  of Bromley Common, with some complex hybrids of Gladiolus. This skilful
  horticulturist possessed a number of French varieties, differing from
  each other only in the colour and size of the flowers, all descended from
  Gandavensis, a well-known old hybrid, said to be descended from <i>G.
  Natalensis</i> by the pollen of <i>G. oppositiflorus</i>.<a
  name="NtA_321" href="#Nt_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> Mr. Rawson, after
  repeated trials, found that none of the varieties would set seed with
  their own pollen, although <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>{140}</span>taken from distinct plants of the same
  variety, which had, of course, been propagated by bulbs, but that they
  all seeded freely with pollen from any other variety. To give two
  examples: Ophir did not produce a capsule with its own pollen, but when
  fertilised with that of Janire, Brenchleyensis, Vulcain, and Linné, it
  produced ten fine capsules; but the pollen of Ophir was good, for when
  Linné was fertilised by it seven capsules were produced. This later
  variety, on the other hand, was utterly barren with its own pollen, which
  we have seen was perfectly efficient on Ophir. Altogether, Mr. Rawson, in
  the year 1861, fertilised twenty-six flowers borne by four varieties with
  pollen taken from other varieties, and every single flower produced a
  fine seed-capsule; whereas fifty-two flowers on the same plants,
  fertilised at the same time with their own pollen, did not yield a single
  seed-capsule. Mr. Rawson fertilised, in some cases, the alternate
  flowers, and in other cases all those down one side of the spike, with
  pollen of other varieties, and the remaining flowers with their own
  pollen; I saw these plants when the capsules were nearly mature, and
  their curious arrangement at once brought full conviction to the mind
  that an immense advantage had been derived from crossing these
  hybrids.</p>

  <p>Lastly, I have heard from Dr. E. Bornet, of Antibes, who has made
  numerous experiments in crossing the species of Cistus, but as not yet
  published the results, that, when any of these hybrids are fertile, they
  may be said to be, in regard to function, di&oelig;cious; "for the
  flowers are always sterile when the pistil is fertilised by pollen taken
  from the same flower or from flowers on the same plant. But they are
  often fertile if pollen be employed from a distinct individual of the
  same hybrid nature, or from a hybrid made by a reciprocal cross."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Conclusion.</i>&mdash;The facts just given, which show that certain
  plants are self-sterile, although both sexual elements are in a fit state
  for reproduction when united with distinct individuals of the same or
  other species, appear at first sight opposed to all analogy. The sexual
  elements of the same flower have become, as already remarked,
  differentiated in relation to each other, almost like those of two
  distinct species.</p>

  <p>With respect to the species which, whilst living under their natural
  conditions, have their reproductive organs in this peculiar state, we may
  conclude that it has been naturally acquired for the sake of effectually
  preventing self-fertilisation. The case is closely analous with dimorphic
  and trimorphic plants, which can be fully fertilised only by plants
  belong to the opposite form, and not, as in the foregoing cases, in
  differently by any other plant. Some of these dimorphic plants are
  completely sterile with pollen taken from the same plant or from the same
  <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>{141}</span>form. It is interesting to observe the
  graduated series from plants which, when fertilised by their own pollen,
  yield the full number of seed, but with the seedlings a little dwarfed in
  stature&mdash;to plants which when self-fertilised yield few
  seeds&mdash;to those with yield none&mdash;and, lastly, to those in which
  the plant's own pollen and stigma act on each other like poison. This
  peculiar state of the reproductive organs, when occurring in certain
  individuals alone, is evidently abnormal; and as it chiefly affects
  exotic plants, or indigenous plants cultivated in pots, we may attribute
  it to some change in the conditions of life, acting on the plants
  themselves or on their parents. The self-impotent <i>Passiflora
  alata</i>, which recovered its self-fertility after having been grafted
  on a distinct stock, shows how small a change is sufficient to act
  powerfully on the reproductive system. The possibility of a plant
  becoming under culture self-impotent is interesting as throwing light on
  the occurrence of this same condition in natural species. A cultivated
  plant in this state generally remains so during its whole life; and from
  this fact we may infer that the state is probably congenital.</p>

  <p>Kölreuter, however, has described some plants of Verbascum which
  varied in this respect even during the same season. As in all the normal
  cases, and in many, probably in most, of the abnormal cases, any two
  self-impotent plants can reciprocally fertilize each other, we may infer
  that a very slight difference in the nature of their sexual elements
  suffices to give fertility; but in other instances, as with some
  Passifloras and the hybrid Gladioli, a greater degree of differentiation
  appears to be necessary, for with these plants fertility is gained only
  by the union of distinct species, or of hybrids of distinct parentage.
  These facts all point to the same general conclusion, namely, that good
  is derived from a cross between individuals, which either innately, or
  from exposure to dissimilar conditions, have come to differ in sexual
  constitution.</p>

  <p>Exotic animals confined in menageries are sometimes in nearly the same
  state as the above-described self-impotent plants; for, as we shall see
  in the following chapter, certain monkeys, the larger carnivora, several
  finches, geese, and pheasants, cross together, quite as freely as, or
  even more freely than, the individuals of the same species breed
  together. Cases will, <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page142"></a>{142}</span>also, be given of sexual incompatibility
  between certain male and female domesticated animals, which,
  nevertheless, are fertile when matched with any other individual of the
  same kind.</p>

  <p>In the early part of this chapter it was shown that the crossing of
  distinct forms, whether closely or distantly allied, gives increased size
  and constitutional vigour, and, except in the case of crossed species,
  increased fertility, to the offspring. The evidence rests on the
  universal testimony of breeders (for it should be observed that I am not
  here speaking of the evil results of close interbreeding), and is
  practically exemplified in the higher value of cross-bred animals for
  immediate consumption. The good results of crossing have also been
  demonstrated, in the case of some animals and of numerous plants, by
  actual weight and measurement. Although animals of pure blood will
  obviously be deteriorated by crossing, as far as their characteristic
  qualities are concerned, there seems to be no exception to the rule that
  advantages of the kind just mentioned are thus gained, even when there
  has not been any previous close interbreeding. The rule applies to all
  animals, even to cattle and sheep, which can long resist breeding
  in-and-in between the nearest blood-relations. It applies to individuals
  of the same sub-variety but of distinct families, to varieties or races,
  to sub-species, as well as to quite distinct species.</p>

  <p>In this latter case, however, whilst size, vigour, precocity, and
  hardiness are, with rare exceptions, gained, fertility, in a greater or
  less degree, is lost; but the gain cannot be exclusively attributed to
  the principle of compensation; for there is no close parallelism between
  the increased size and vigour of the offspring and their sterility.
  Moreover it has been clearly proved that mongrels which are perfectly
  fertile gain these same advantages as well as sterile hybrids.</p>

  <p>The evil consequences of long-continued close interbreeding are not so
  easily recognised as the good effects from crossing, for the
  deterioration is gradual. Nevertheless it is the general opinion of those
  who have had most experience, especially with animals which propagate
  quickly, that evil does inevitably follow sooner or later, but at
  different rates with different animals. No doubt a false belief may
  widely prevail like a superstition; yet it is difficult to suppose that
  so many acute and original <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>{143}</span>observers have all been deceived at the
  expense of much cost and trouble. A male animal may sometimes be paired
  with his daughter, granddaughter, and so on, even for seven generations,
  without any manifest bad result; but the experiment has never been tried
  of matching brothers and sisters, which is considered the closest form of
  interbreeding, for an equal number of generations. There is good reason
  to believe that by keeping the members of the same family in distinct
  bodies, especially if exposed to somewhat different conditions of life,
  and by occasionally crossing these families, the evil results may be much
  diminished, or quite eliminated. These results are loss of constitutional
  vigour, size, and fertility; but there is no necessary deterioration in
  the general form of the body, or in other good qualities. We have seen
  that with pigs first-rate animals have been produced after long-continued
  close interbreeding, though they had become extremely infertile when
  paired with their near relations. The loss of fertility, when it occurs,
  seems never to be absolute, but only relative to animals of the same
  blood; so that this sterility is to a certain extent analogous with that
  of self-impotent plants which cannot be fertilised by their own pollen,
  but are perfectly fertile with pollen of any other plant of the same
  species. The fact of infertility of this peculiar nature being one of the
  results of long-continued interbreeding, shows that interbreeding does
  not act merely by combining and augmenting various morbid tendencies
  common to both parents; for animals with such tendencies, if not at the
  time actually ill, can generally propagate their kind. Although offspring
  descended from the nearest blood-relations are not necessarily
  deteriorated in structure, yet some authors<a name="NtA_322"
  href="#Nt_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a> believe that they are eminently
  liable to malformations; and this is not improbable, as everything which
  lessens the vital powers acts in this manner. Instances of this kind have
  been recorded in the case of pigs, bloodhounds, and some other
  animals.</p>

  <p>Finally, when we consider the various facts now given which plainly
  show that good follows from crossing, and less plainly <!-- Page 144
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>{144}</span>that evil
  follows from close interbreeding, and when we bear in mind that
  throughout the whole organic world elaborate provision has been made for
  the occasional union of distinct individuals, the existence of a great
  law of nature is, if not proved, at least rendered in the highest degree
  probable; namely, that the crossing of animals and plants which are not
  closely related to beach other is highly beneficial or even necessary,
  and that interbreeding prolonged during many generations is highly
  injurious.</p>

  <p><i>On the Good derived from slight Changes in the Conditions of
  Life.</i>&mdash;In considering whether any facts were known which might
  throw light on the conclusion arrived at in the last chapter, namely,
  that benefits ensue from crossing, and that it is a law of nature that
  all organic beings should occasionally cross, it appeared to me probable
  that the good derived from slight changes in the conditions of life, from
  being an analogous phenomenon, might serve this purpose. No two
  individuals, and still less no two varieties, are absolutely alike in
  constitution and structure; and when the germ of one is fertilised by the
  male element of another, we may believe that it is acted on in a somewhat
  similar manner as an individual when exposed to slightly changed
  conditions. Now, every one must have observed the remarkable influence on
  convalescents of a change of residence, and no medical man doubts the
  truth of this fact. Small farmers who hold but little land are convinced
  that their cattle derive great benefit from a change of pasture. In the
  case of plants, the evidence is strong that a great advantage is derived
  from exchanging seeds, tubers, bulbs, and cuttings from one soil or place
  to another as different as possible. <!-- Page 146 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>{146}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The belief that plants are thus benefited, whether or not well
  founded, has been firmly maintained from the time of Columella, who wrote
  shortly after the Christian era, to the present day; and it now prevails
  in England, France, and Germany.<a name="NtA_323"
  href="#Nt_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> A sagacious observer, Bradley,
  writing in 1724,<a name="NtA_324" href="#Nt_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a>
  says, "When we once become Masters of a good Sort of Seed, we should at
  least put it into Two or Three Hands, where the Soils and Situations are
  as different as possible; and every Year the Parties should change with
  one another; by which Means, I find the Goodness of the Seed will be
  maintained for several Years. For Want of this Use many Farmers have
  failed in their Crops and been great Losers." He then gives his own
  practical experience on this head. A modern writer<a name="NtA_325"
  href="#Nt_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> asserts, "Nothing can be more clearly
  established in agriculture than that the continual growth of any one
  variety in the same district makes it liable to deterioration either in
  quality or quantity." Another writer states that he sowed close together
  in the same field two lots of wheat-seed, the product of the same
  original stock, one of which had been grown on the same land, and the
  other at a distance, and the difference in favour of the crop from the
  latter seed was remarkable. A gentleman in Surrey who has long made it
  his business to raise wheat to sell for seed, and who has constantly
  realised in the market higher prices than others, assures me that he
  finds it indispensable continually to change his seed; and that for this
  purpose he keeps two farms differing much in soil and elevation.</p>

  <p>With respect to the tubers of the potato, I find that at the present
  day the practice of exchanging sets is almost everywhere followed. The
  great growers of potatoes in Lancashire formerly used to get tubers from
  Scotland, but they found that "a change from the moss-lands, and <i>vice
  versâ</i>, was generally sufficient." In former times in France the crop
  of potatoes in the Vosges had become reduced in the course of fifty or
  sixty years in the proportion from 120-150 to 30-40 bushels; and the
  famous Oberlin attributed the surprising good which he effected in large
  part to changing the sets.<a name="NtA_326"
  href="#Nt_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A well-known practical gardener, Mr. Robson<a name="NtA_327"
  href="#Nt_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> positively states that he has himself
  witnessed decided advantage from obtaining bulbs of the onion, tubers of
  the potato, and various seeds, all of the same kind, from different soils
  and distant parts of England. He further states that with <!-- Page 147
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>{147}</span>plants
  propagated by cuttings, as with the Pelargonium, and especially the
  Dahlia, manifest advantage is derived from getting plans of the same
  variety, which have been cultivated in another place; or, "where the
  extent of the place allows, to take cuttings from one description of soil
  to plant on another, so as to afford the change that seems so necessary
  to the well-being of the plants." He maintains that after a time an
  exchange of this nature is "forced on the grower, whether he be prepared
  for it or not." Similar remarks have been made by another excellent
  gardener, Mr. Fish, namely, that cuttings of the same variety of
  Calceolaria, which he obtained from a neighbour, "showed much greater
  vigour than some of his own that were treated in exactly the same
  manner," and he attributed this solely to his own plants having become
  "to a certain extent worn out or tired of their quarters." Something of
  this kind apparently occurs in grafting and budding fruit-trees; for,
  according to Mr. Abbey, grafts or buds generally take on a distinct
  variety or even species, or on a stock previously grafted, with greater
  facility than on stocks raised from seeds of the variety which is to be
  grafted; and he believes this cannot be altogether explained by the
  stocks in question being better adapted to the soil and climate of the
  place. It should, however, be added, that varieties grafted or budded on
  very distinct kinds, though they may take more readily and grow at first
  more vigorously than when grafted on closely allied stocks, afterwards
  often become unhealthy.</p>

  <p>I have studied M. Tessier's careful and elaborate experiments,<a
  name="NtA_328" href="#Nt_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a> made to disprove the
  common belief that good is derived from a change of seed; and he
  certainly shows that the same seed may with care be cultivated on the
  same farm (it is not stated whether on exactly the same soil) for ten
  consecutive years without loss. Another excellent observer, Colonel Le
  Couteur,<a name="NtA_329" href="#Nt_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a> has come to
  the same conclusion; but then he expressly adds, if the same seed be
  used, "that which is grown on land manured from the mixen one year
  becomes seed for land prepared with lime, and that again becomes seed for
  land dressed with ashes, then for land dressed with mixed manure, and so
  on." But this in effect is a systematic exchange of seed, within the
  limits of the same farm.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On the whole the belief, which has long been held by many skilful
  cultivators, that good follows from exchanging seed, tubers, &amp;c.,
  seems to be fairly well founded. Considering the small size of most
  seeds, it seems hardly credible that the advantage thus derived can be
  due to the seeds obtaining in one soil some chemical element deficient in
  the other soil. As plants after once germinating naturally become fixed
  to the same spot, it might have been anticipated that they would show the
  good effects of a change more plainly than animals, which continually
  wander about; and this apparently is the <!-- Page 148 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>{148}</span>case. Life depending
  on, or consisting in, an incessant play of the most complex forces, it
  would appear that their action is in some way stimulated by slight
  changes in the circumstances to which each organism is exposed. All
  forces throughout nature, as Mr. Herbert Spencer<a name="NtA_330"
  href="#Nt_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> remarks, tend towards an equilibrium,
  and for the life of each being it is necessary that this tendency should
  be checked. If these views and the foregoing facts can be trusted, they
  probably throw light, on the one hand, on the good effects of crossing
  the breed, for the germ will be thus slightly modified or acted on by new
  forces; and on the other hand, on the evil effects of close interbreeding
  prolonged during many generations, during which the germ will be acted on
  by a male having almost identically the same constitution.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Sterility from changed Conditions of Life.</i></p>

  <p>I will now attempt to show that animals and plants, when removed from
  their natural conditions, are often rendered in some degree infertile or
  completely barren; and this occurs even when the conditions have not been
  greatly changed. This conclusion is not necessarily opposed to that at
  which we have just arrived, namely, that lesser changes of other kinds
  are advantageous to organic beings. Our present subject is of some
  importance, from having an intimate connexion with the causes of
  variability. Indirectly it perhaps bears on the sterility of species when
  crossed: for as, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions of
  life are favourable to plants and animals, and the crossing of varieties
  adds to the size, vigour, and fertility of their offspring; so, on the
  other hand, certain other changes in the conditions of life cause
  sterility; and as this likewise ensues from crossing much-modified forms
  or species, we have a parallel and double series of facts, which
  apparently stand in close relation to each other.</p>

  <p>It is notorious that many animals, though perfectly tamed, <!-- Page
  149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>{149}</span>refuse to
  breed in captivity. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire<a name="NtA_331"
  href="#Nt_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a> consequently has drawn a broad
  distinction between tamed animals which will not breed under captivity,
  and truly domesticated animals which breed freely&mdash;generally more
  freely, as shown in the sixteenth chapter, than in a state of nature. It
  is possible and generally easy to tame most animals; but experience has
  shown that it is difficult to get them to breed regularly, or even at
  all. I shall discuss this subject in detail; but will give only those
  cases which seem most illustrative. My materials are derived from notices
  scattered through various works, and especially from a Report, drawn up
  for me by the kindness of the officers of the Zoological Society of
  London, which has especial value, as it records all the cases, during
  nine years from 1838-46, in which the animals were seen to couple but
  produced no offspring, as well as the cases in which they never, as far
  as known, coupled. This MS. Report I have corrected by the annual Reports
  subsequently published. Many facts are given on the breeding of the
  animals in that magnificent work, 'Gleanings from the Menageries of
  Knowsley Hall,' by Dr. Gray. I made, also, particular inquiries from the
  experienced keeper of the birds in the old Surrey Zoological Gardens. I
  should premise that a slight change in the treatment of animals sometimes
  makes a great difference in their fertility; and it is probable that the
  results observed in different menageries would differ. Indeed some
  animals in our Zoological Gardens have become more productive since the
  year 1846. It is, also, manifest from F. Cuvier's account of the Jardin
  des Plantes,<a name="NtA_332" href="#Nt_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> that
  the animals formerly bred much less freely there than with us; for
  instance, in the Duck tribe, which is highly prolific, only one species
  had at that period produced young.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The most remarkable cases, however, are afforded by animals kept in
  their native country, which, though perfectly tamed, quite healthy, and
  allowed some freedom, are absolutely incapable of breeding. Rengger,<a
  name="NtA_333" href="#Nt_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a> who in Paraguay
  particularly attended to this subject, specifies six quadrupeds in this
  condition; and he mentions two or three others which most rarely <!--
  Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span>breed. Mr. Bates, in his admirable work on
  the Amazons, strongly insists on similar cases;<a name="NtA_334"
  href="#Nt_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> and he remarks, that the fact of
  thoroughly tamed native mammals and birds not breeding when kept by the
  Indians, cannot be wholly accounted for by their negligence or
  indifference, for the turkey is valued by them, and the fowl has been
  adopted by the remotest tribes. In almost every part of the
  world&mdash;for instance, in the interior of Africa, and in several of
  the Polynesian islands&mdash;the natives are extremely fond of taming the
  indigenous quadrupeds and birds; but they rarely or never succeed in
  getting them to breed.</p>

  <p>The most notorious case of an animal not breeding in captivity is that
  of the elephant. Elephants are kept in large numbers in their native
  Indian home, live to old age, and are vigorous enough for the severest
  labour; yet, with one or two exceptions, they have never been known even
  to couple, though both males and females have their proper periodical
  seasons. If, however, we proceed a little eastward to Ava, we hear from
  Mr. Crawfurd<a name="NtA_335" href="#Nt_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a> that
  their "breeding in the domestic state, or at least in the half-domestic
  state in which the female elephants are generally kept, is of every-day
  occurrence;" and Mr. Crawfurd informs me that he believes that the
  difference must be attributed solely to the females being allowed to roam
  the forests with some degree of freedom. The captive rhinoceros, on the
  other hand, seems from Bishop Heber's account<a name="NtA_336"
  href="#Nt_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a> to breed in India far more readily
  than the elephant. Four wild species of the horse genus have bred in
  Europe, though here exposed to a great change in their natural habits of
  life; but the species have generally been crossed one with another. Most
  of the members of the pig family breed readily in our menageries: even
  the Red River hog (<i>Potamoch&oelig;rus penicillatus</i>), from the
  sweltering plains of West Africa, has bred twice in the Zoological
  Gardens. Here also the Peccary (<i>Dicotyles torquatus</i>) has bred
  several times; but another species, the <i>D. labiatus</i>, though
  rendered so tame as to be half-domesticated, breeds so rarely in its
  native country of Paraguay, that according to Rengger<a name="NtA_337"
  href="#Nt_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a> the fact requires confirmation. Mr.
  Bates remarks that the tapir, though often kept tame in Amazonia by the
  Indians, never breeds.</p>

  <p>Ruminants generally breed quite freely in England, though brought from
  widely different climates, as may be seen in the Annual Reports of the
  Zoological Gardens, and in the Gleanings from Lord Derby's menagerie.</p>

  <p>The Carnivora, with the exception of the Plantigrade division,
  generally breed (though with capricious exceptions) almost as freely as
  ruminants. Many species of Felidæ have bred in various menageries,
  although imported from various climates and closely confined. Mr.
  Bartlett, the present superintendent of the Zoological Gardens,<a
  name="NtA_338" href="#Nt_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> remarks that the lion
  appears to breed more frequently and to bring forth more young at a birth
  than any other species of the family. He adds that the tiger has rarely
  bred; <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>{151}</span>"but there are several well-authenticated
  instances of the female tiger breeding with the lion." Strange as the
  fact may appear, many animals under confinement unite with distinct
  species and produce hybrids quite as freely as, or even more freely than,
  with their own species. On inquiring from Dr. Falconer and others, it
  appears that the tiger when confined in India does not breed, though it
  has been known to couple. The cheetah (<i>Felis jubata</i>) has never
  been known by Mr. Bartlett to breed in England, but it has bred at
  Frankfort; nor does it breed in India, where it is kept in large numbers
  for hunting; but no pains would be taken to make them breed, as only
  those animals which have hunted for themselves in a state of nature are
  serviceable and worth training.<a name="NtA_339"
  href="#Nt_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a> According to Rengger, two species of
  wild cats in Paraguay, though thoroughly tamed, have never bred. Although
  so many of the Felidæ breed readily in the Zoological Gardens, yet
  conception by no means always follows union: in the nine-year Report,
  various species are specified which were observed to couple seventy-three
  times, and no doubt this must have passed many times unnoticed; yet from
  the seventy-three unions only fifteen births ensued. The Carnivora in the
  Zoological Gardens were formerly less freely exposed to the air and cold
  than at present, and this change of treatment, as I was assured by the
  former superintendent, Mr. Miller, greatly increased their fertility. Mr.
  Bartlett, and there cannot be a more capable judge, says, "it is
  remarkable that lions breed more freely in travelling collections than in
  the Zoological Gardens; probably the constant excitement and irritation
  produced by moving from place to place, or change of air, may have
  considerable influence in the matter."</p>

  <p>Many members of the Dog family breed readily when confined. The Dhole
  is one of the most untameable animals in India, yet a pair kept there by
  Dr. Falconer produced young. Foxes, on the other hand, rarely breed, and
  I have never heard of such an occurrence with the European fox: the
  silver fox of North America (<i>Canis argentatus</i>), however, has bred
  several times in the Zoological Gardens. Even the otter has bred there.
  Every one knows how readily the semi-domesticated ferret breeds, though
  shut up in miserably small cages; but other species of Viverra and
  Paradoxurus absolutely refuse to breed in the Zoological Gardens. The
  Genetta has bred both here and in the Jardin des Plantes, and produced
  hybrids. The <i>Herpestes fasciatus</i> has likewise bred; but I was
  formerly assured that the <i>H. griseus</i>, though many were kept in the
  Gardens, never bred.</p>

  <p>The Plantigrade Carnivora breed under confinement much less freely,
  without our being able to assign any reason, than other members of the
  group. In the nine-year Report it is stated that the bears had been seen
  in the Zoological Gardens to couple freely, but previously to 1848 had
  most rarely conceived. In the Reports published since this date three
  species have produced young (hybrids in one case), and, wonderful to
  relate, the white Polar bear has produced young. The badger (<i>Meles
  taxus</i>) has bred several times in the Gardens; but I have not heard of
  this <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page152"></a>{152}</span>occurring elsewhere in England, and the
  event must be very rare, for an instance in Germany has been thought
  worth recording.<a name="NtA_340" href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> In
  Paraguay the native Nasua, though kept in pairs during many years and
  perfectly tamed, has never been known, according to Rengger, to breed or
  show any sexual passion; nor, as I hear from Mr. Bates, does this animal,
  or the Cercoleptes, breed in the region of the Amazons. Two other
  plantigrade genera, Procyon and Gulo, though often kept tame in Paraguay,
  never breed there. In the Zoological Gardens species of Nasua and Procyon
  have been seen to couple; but they did not produce young.</p>

  <p>As domesticated rabbits, guinea-pigs, and white mice breed so
  abundantly when closely confined under various climates, it might have
  been thought that most other members of the Rodent order would have bred
  in captivity, but this is not the case. It deserves notice, as showing
  how the capacity to breed sometimes goes by affinity, that the one native
  rodent of Paraguay, which there breeds <i>freely</i> and has yielded
  successive generations, is the <i>Cavia aperea</i>; and this animal is so
  closely allied to the guinea-pig, that it has been erroneously thought to
  be the parent-form.<a name="NtA_341" href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a>
  In the Zoological Gardens, some rodents have coupled, but have never
  produced young; some have neither coupled nor bred; but a few have bred,
  as the porcupine more than once, the Barbary mouse, lemming, chinchilla,
  and the agouti (<i>Dasyprocta aguti</i>), several times. This latter
  animal has also produced young in Paraguay, though they were born dead
  and ill-formed; but in Amazonia, according to Mr. Bates, it never breeds,
  though often kept tame about the houses. Nor does the paca
  (<i>C&oelig;logenys paca</i>) breed there. The common hare when confined
  has, I believe, never bred in Europe;<a name="NtA_342"
  href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a> though, according to a recent
  statement, it has crossed with the rabbit. I have never heard of the
  dormouse breeding in confinement. But squirrels offer a more curious
  case: with one exception, no species has ever bred in the Zoological
  Gardens, yet as many as fourteen individuals of <i>S. palmarum</i> were
  kept together during several years. The <i>S. cinerea</i> has been seen
  to couple, but it did not produce young; nor has this species, when
  rendered extremely tame in its native country, North America, been ever
  known to breed.<a name="NtA_343" href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a> At
  Lord Derby's menagerie squirrels of many kinds were kept in numbers, but
  Mr. Thompson, the superintendent, told me that none had ever bred there,
  or elsewhere as far as he knew. I have never heard of the English
  squirrel breeding in confinement. But the species which has bred more
  than once in the Zoological Gardens is the one which perhaps might have
  been least expected, namely, the flying squirrel (<i>Sciuropterus
  volucella</i>): it has, also, bred several times <!-- Page 153 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span>near Birmingham; but
  the female never produced more than two young at a birth, whereas in its
  native American home she bears from three to six young.<a name="NtA_344"
  href="#Nt_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Monkeys, in the nine-year Report from the Zoological Gardens, are
  stated to unite most freely, but during this period, though many
  individuals were kept, there were only seven births. I have heard of one
  American monkey alone, the Ouistiti, breeding in Europe.<a name="NtA_345"
  href="#Nt_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> A Macacus, according to Flourens,
  bred in Paris; and more than one species of this genus has produced young
  in London, especially the <i>Macacus rhesus</i>, which everywhere shows a
  special capacity to breed under confinement. Hybrids have been produced
  both in Paris and London from this same genus. The Arabian baboon, or
  <i>Cynocephalus hamadryas</i>,<a name="NtA_346"
  href="#Nt_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> and a Cercopithecus have bred in the
  Zoological Gardens, and the latter species at the Duke of
  Northumberland's. Several members of the family of Lemurs have produced
  hybrids in the Zoological Gardens. It is much more remarkable that
  monkeys very rarely breed when confined in their native country; thus the
  Cay (<i>Cebus azaræ</i>) is frequently and completely tamed in Paraguay,
  but Rengger<a name="NtA_347" href="#Nt_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a> says
  that it breeds so rarely, that he never saw more than two females which
  had produced young. A similar observation has been made with respect to
  the monkeys which are frequently tamed by the aborigines in Brazil.<a
  name="NtA_348" href="#Nt_348"><sup>[348]</sup></a> In the region of the
  Amazons, these animals are so often kept in a tame state, that Mr. Bates
  in walking through the streets of Parà counted thirteen species; but, as
  he asserts, they have never been known to breed in captivity.<a
  name="NtA_349" href="#Nt_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Birds.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Birds offer in some respects better evidence than quadrupeds, from
  their breeding more rapidly and being kept in greater numbers. We have
  seen that carnivorous animals are more fertile under confinement than
  most other mammals. The reverse holds good with carnivorous birds. It is
  said<a name="NtA_350" href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> that as many as
  eighteen species have been used in Europe for hawking, and several others
  in Persia and India;<a name="NtA_351" href="#Nt_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a>
  they have been kept in their native country in the finest condition, and
  have been flown during six, eight, or nine years;<a name="NtA_352"
  href="#Nt_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a> yet there is no record of their
  having ever produced young. As these birds were formerly caught whilst
  young, at great expense, being imported from Iceland, Norway, and Sweden,
  there can <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>{154}</span>be little doubt that, if possible, they
  would have been propagated. In the Jardin des Plantes, no bird of prey
  has been known to couple.<a name="NtA_353"
  href="#Nt_353"><sup>[353]</sup></a> No hawk, vulture, or owl has ever
  produced fertile eggs in the Zoological Gardens, or in the old Surrey
  Gardens, with the exception, in the former place on one occasion, of a
  condor and a kite (<i>Milvus niger</i>). Yet several species, namely, the
  <i>Aquila fusca</i>, <i>Haliætus leucocephalus</i>, <i>Falco
  tinnunculus</i>, <i>F. subbuteo</i>, and <i>Buteo vulgaris</i>, have been
  seen to couple in the Zoological Gardens. Mr. Morris<a name="NtA_354"
  href="#Nt_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a> mentions as a unique fact that a
  kestrel (<i>Falco tinnunculus</i>) bred in an aviary. The one kind of owl
  which has been known to couple in the Zoological Gardens was the Eagle
  Owl (<i>Bubo maximus</i>); and this species shows a special inclination
  to breed in captivity; for a pair at Arundel Castle, kept more nearly in
  a state of nature "than ever fell to the lot of an animal deprived of its
  liberty,"<a name="NtA_355" href="#Nt_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a> actually
  reared their young. Mr. Gurney has given another instance of this same
  owl breeding in confinement; and he records the case of a second species
  of owl, the <i>Strix passerina</i>, breeding in captivity.<a
  name="NtA_356" href="#Nt_356"><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of the smaller graminivorous birds, many kinds have been kept tame in
  their native countries, and have lived long; yet, as the highest
  authority on cage-birds<a name="NtA_357"
  href="#Nt_357"><sup>[357]</sup></a> remarks, their propagation is
  "uncommonly difficult." The canary-bird shows that there is no inherent
  difficulty in these birds breeding freely in confinement; and Audubon
  says<a name="NtA_358" href="#Nt_358"><sup>[358]</sup></a> that the
  <i>Fringilla</i> (<i>Spiza</i>) <i>ciris</i> of North America breeds as
  perfectly as the canary. The difficulty with the many finches which have
  been kept in confinement is all the more remarkable as more than a dozen
  species could be named which have yielded hybrids with the canary; but
  hardly any of these, with the exception of the siskin (<i>Fringilla
  spinus</i>), have reproduced their own kind. Even the bullfinch (<i>Loxia
  pyrrhula</i>) has bred as frequently with the canary, though belonging to
  a distinct genus, as with its own species.<a name="NtA_359"
  href="#Nt_359"><sup>[359]</sup></a> With respect to the skylark
  (<i>Alauda arvensis</i>), I have heard of birds living for seven years in
  an aviary, which never produced young; and a great London bird-fancier
  assured me that he had never known an instance of their breeding;
  nevertheless one case has been recorded.<a name="NtA_360"
  href="#Nt_360"><sup>[360]</sup></a> In the nine-year Report from the
  Zoological Society, twenty-four incessorial species are enumerated which
  had not bred, and of these only four were known to have coupled.</p>

  <p>Parrots are singularly long-lived birds; and Humboldt mentions the
  curious fact of a parrot in South America, which spoke the language of
  <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page155"></a>{155}</span>an extinct Indian tribe, so that this bird
  preserved the sole relic of a lost language. Even in this country there
  is reason to believe<a name="NtA_361" href="#Nt_361"><sup>[361]</sup></a>
  that parrots have lived to the age of nearly one hundred years; yet,
  though many have been kept in Europe, they breed so rarely that the event
  has been thought worth recording in the gravest publications.<a
  name="NtA_362" href="#Nt_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a> According to
  Bechstein<a name="NtA_363" href="#Nt_363"><sup>[363]</sup></a> the
  African <i>Psittacus erithacus</i> breeds oftener than any other species:
  the <i>P. macoa</i> occasionally lays fertile eggs, but rarely succeeds
  in hatching them; this bird, however, has the instinct of incubation
  sometimes so strongly developed, that it will hatch the eggs of fowls or
  pigeons. In the Zoological Gardens and in the old Surrey Gardens some few
  species have coupled, but, with the exception of three species of
  parrakeets, none have bred. It is a much more remarkable fact that in
  Guiana parrots of two kinds, as I am informed by Sir E. Schomburgk, are
  often taken from the nests by the Indians and reared in large numbers;
  they are so tame that they fly freely about the houses, and come when
  called to be fed, like pigeons; yet he has never heard of a single
  instance of their breeding.<a name="NtA_364"
  href="#Nt_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a> In Jamaica, a resident naturalist,
  Mr. R. Hill,<a name="NtA_365" href="#Nt_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a> says,
  "no birds more readily submit to human dependence than the parrot-tribe,
  but no instance of a parrot breeding in this tame life has been known
  yet." Mr. Hill specifies a number of other native birds kept tame in the
  West Indies, which never breed in this state.</p>

  <p>The great pigeon family offers a striking contrast with parrots: in
  the nine-year Report thirteen species are recorded as having bred, and,
  what is more noticeable, only two were seen to couple without any result.
  Since the above date every annual Report gives many cases of various
  pigeons breeding. The two magnificent crowned pigeons (<i>Goura
  coronata</i> and <i>Victoriæ</i>) produced hybrids; nevertheless, of the
  former species more than a dozen birds were kept, as I am informed by Mr.
  Crawfurd, in a park at Penang, under a perfectly well-adapted climate,
  but never once bred. The <i>Columba migratoria</i> in its native country,
  North America, invariably lays two eggs, but in Lord Derby's menagerie
  never more than one. The same fact has been observed with the <i>C.
  leucocephala</i>.<a name="NtA_366"
  href="#Nt_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Gallinaceous birds of many genera likewise show an eminent capacity
  for breeding under captivity. This is particularly the case with
  pheasants; yet our English species seldom lays more than ten eggs in
  confinement; whilst from eighteen to twenty is the usual number in the
  wild state.<a name="NtA_367" href="#Nt_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a> With the
  Gallinaceæ, as with all other orders, there are marked and <!-- Page 156
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span>inexplicable
  exceptions in regard to the fertility of certain species and genera under
  confinement. Although many trials have been made with the common
  partridge, it has rarely bred, even when reared in large aviaries; and
  the hen will never hatch her own eggs.<a name="NtA_368"
  href="#Nt_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a> The American tribe of Guans or
  Cracidæ are tamed with remarkable ease, but are very shy breeders in this
  country;<a name="NtA_369" href="#Nt_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a> but with
  care various species were formerly made to breed rather freely in
  Holland.<a name="NtA_370" href="#Nt_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a> Birds of
  this tribe are often kept in a perfectly tamed condition in their native
  country by the Indians, but they never breed.<a name="NtA_371"
  href="#Nt_371"><sup>[371]</sup></a> It might have been expected that
  grouse from their habits of life would not have bred in captivity, more
  especially as they are said soon to languish and die.<a name="NtA_372"
  href="#Nt_372"><sup>[372]</sup></a> But many cases are recorded of their
  breeding: the capercailzie (<i>Tetrao urogallus</i>) has bred in the
  Zoological Gardens; it breeds without much difficulty when confined in
  Norway, and in Russia five successive generations have been reared:
  <i>Tetrao tetrix</i> has likewise bred in Norway; <i>T. Scoticus</i> in
  Ireland; <i>T. umbellus</i> at Lord Derby's; and <i>T. cupido</i> in
  North America.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely possible to imagine a greater change in habits than
  that which the members of the ostrich family must suffer, when cooped up
  in small enclosures under a temperate climate, after freely roaming over
  desert and tropical plains or entangled forests. Yet almost all the
  kinds, even the mooruk (<i><span class="correction" title="Original reads `Casuarinus', corrected by errata, page viii."
  >Casuarius</span>  Bennettii</i>) from New Ireland, has frequently
  produced young in the various European menageries. The African ostrich,
  though perfectly healthy and living long in the South of France, never
  lays more than from twelve to fifteen eggs, though in its native country
  it lays from twenty-five to thirty.<a name="NtA_373"
  href="#Nt_373"><sup>[373]</sup></a> Here we have another instance of
  fertility impaired, but not lost, under confinement, as with the flying
  squirrel, the hen-pheasant, and two species of American pigeons.</p>

  <p>Most Waders can be tamed, as the Rev. E.&nbsp;S. Dixon informs me, with
  remarkable facility; but several of them are short-lived under
  confinement, so that their sterility in this state is not surprising. The
  cranes breed more readily than other genera: <i>Grus montigresia</i> has
  bred several times in Paris and in the Zoological Gardens, as has <i>G.
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads `cineria', corrected by errata, page viii."
  >cinerea</span></i> at the latter place, and <i>G. antigone</i> at
  Calcutta. Of other members of this great order, <i>Tetrapteryx
  paradisea</i> has bred at Knowsley, a Porphyrio in Sicily, and the
  <i>Gallinula chloropus</i> in the Zoological Gardens. On the other hand,
  several <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page157"></a>{157}</span>birds belonging to this order will not
  breed in their native country, Jamaica; and the Psophia, though often
  kept by the Indians of Guiana about their houses, "is seldom or never
  known to breed."<a name="NtA_374" href="#Nt_374"><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>

  <p>No birds breed with such complete facility under confinement as the
  members of the great Duck family; yet, considering their aquatic and
  wandering habits, and the nature of their food, this could not have been
  anticipated. Even some time ago above two dozen species had bred in the
  Zoological Gardens; and M. Selys-Longchamps has recorded the production
  of hybrids from forty-four different members of the family; and to these
  Professor Newton has added a few more cases.<a name="NtA_375"
  href="#Nt_375"><sup>[375]</sup></a> "There is not," says Mr. Dixon,<a
  name="NtA_376" href="#Nt_376"><sup>[376]</sup></a> "in the wide world, a
  goose which is not in the strict sense of the word domesticable;" that
  is, capable of breeding under confinement; but this statement is probably
  too bold. The capacity to breed sometimes varies in individuals of the
  same species; thus Audubon<a name="NtA_377"
  href="#Nt_377"><sup>[377]</sup></a> kept for more than eight years some
  wild geese (<i>Anser Canadensis</i>), but they would not mate; whilst
  other individuals of the same species produced young during the second
  year. I know of but one instance in the whole family of a species which
  absolutely refuses to breed in captivity, namely, the <i>Dendrocygna
  viduata</i>, although, according to Sir R. Schomburgk,<a name="NtA_378"
  href="#Nt_378"><sup>[378]</sup></a> it is easily tamed, and is frequently
  kept by the Indians of Guiana. Lastly, with respect to Gulls, though many
  have been kept in the Zoological Gardens and in the old Surrey Gardens,
  no instance was known before the year 1848 of their coupling or breeding;
  but since that period the herring gull (<i>Larus argentatus</i>) has bred
  many times in the Zoological Gardens and at Knowsley.</p>

  <p>There is reason to believe that insects are affected by confinement
  like the higher animals. It is well known that the Sphingidæ rarely breed
  when thus treated. An entomologist<a name="NtA_379"
  href="#Nt_379"><sup>[379]</sup></a> in Paris kept twenty-five specimens
  of <i>Saturnia pyri</i>, but did not succeed in getting a single fertile
  egg. A number of females of <i>Orthosia munda</i> and of <i>Mamestra
  suasa</i> reared in confinement were unattractive to the males.<a
  name="NtA_380" href="#Nt_380"><sup>[380]</sup></a> Mr. Newport kept
  nearly a hundred individuals of two species of Vanessa, but not one
  paired; this, however, might have been due to their habit of coupling on
  the wing.<a name="NtA_381" href="#Nt_381"><sup>[381]</sup></a> Mr.
  Atkinson could never succeed in India in making the Tarroo silk-moth
  breed in confinement.<a name="NtA_382"
  href="#Nt_382"><sup>[382]</sup></a> It appears that a number of moths,
  especially the Sphingidæ, when hatched in the autumn out of their proper
  season, <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>{158}</span>are completely barren; but this latter
  case is still involved in some obscurity.<a name="NtA_383"
  href="#Nt_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Independently of the fact of many animals under confinement not
  coupling, or, if they couple, not producing young, there is evidence of
  another kind, that their sexual functions are thus disturbed. For many
  cases have been recorded of the loss by male birds when confined of their
  characteristic plumage. Thus the common linnet (<i>Linota cannabina</i>)
  when caged does not acquire the fine crimson colour on its breast, and
  one of the buntings (<i>Emberiza passerina</i>) loses the black on its
  head. A Pyrrhula and an Oriolus have been observed to assume the quiet
  plumage of the hen-bird; and the <i>Falco albidus</i> returned to the
  dress of an earlier age.<a name="NtA_384"
  href="#Nt_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a> Mr. Thomson, the superintendent of
  the Knowsley menagerie, informed me that he had often observed analogous
  facts. The horns of a male deer (<i>Cervus Canadensis</i>) during the
  voyage from America were badly developed; but subsequently in Paris
  perfect horns were produced.</p>

  <p>When conception takes place under confinement, the young are often
  born dead, or die soon, or are ill-formed. This frequently occurs in the
  Zoological Gardens, and, according to Rengger, with native animals
  confined in Paraguay. The mother's milk often fails. We may also
  attribute to the disturbance of the sexual functions the frequent
  occurrence of that monstrous instinct which leads the mother to devour
  her own offspring,&mdash;a mysterious case of perversion, as it at first
  appears.</p>

  <p>Sufficient evidence has now been advanced to prove that animals when
  first confined are eminently liable to suffer in their reproductive
  systems. We feel at first naturally inclined to attribute the result to
  loss of health, or at least to loss of vigour; but this view can hardly
  be admitted when we reflect how healthy, long-lived, and vigorous many
  animals are under <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span>captivity, such as parrots, and hawks when
  used for hawking, chetahs when used for hunting, and elephants. The
  reproductive organs themselves are not diseased; and the diseases, from
  which animals in menageries usually perish, are not those which in any
  way affect their fertility. No domestic animal is more subject too
  disease than the sheep, yet it is remarkably prolific. The failure of
  animals to breed under confinement has been sometimes attributed
  exclusively to a failure in their sexual instincts: this may occasionally
  come into play, but there is no obvious reason why this instinct should
  be especially liable to be affected with perfectly tamed animals, except
  indeed indirectly through the reproductive system itself being disturbed.
  Moreover, numerous cases have been given of various animals which couple
  freely under confinement, but never conceive; or, if they conceive and
  produce young, these are fewer in number than is natural to the species.
  In the vegetable kingdom instinct of course can play no part; and we
  shall presently see that plants when removed from their natural
  conditions are affected in nearly the same manner as animals. Change of
  climate cannot be the cause of the loss of fertility, for, whilst many
  animals imported into Europe from extremely different climates breed
  freely, many others when confined in their native land are completely
  sterile. Change of food cannot be the chief cause; for ostriches, ducks,
  and many other animals, which must have undergone a great change in this
  respect, breed freely. Carnivorous birds when confined are extremely
  sterile; whilst most carnivorous mammals, except plantigrades, are
  moderately fertile. Nor can the amount of food be the cause; for a
  sufficient supply will certainly be given to valuable animals; and there
  is no reason to suppose that much more food would be given to them, than
  to our choice domestic productions which retain their full fertility.
  Lastly, we may infer from the case of the elephant, chetah, various
  hawks, and of many animals which are allowed to lead an almost free life
  in their native land, that want of exercise is not the sole cause.</p>

  <p>It would appear that any change in the habits of life, whatever these
  habits may be, if great enough, tends to affect in an inexplicable manner
  the powers of reproduction. The result <!-- Page 160 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>{160}</span>depends more on the
  constitution of the species than on the nature of the change; for certain
  whole groups are affected more than others; but exceptions always occur,
  for some species in the most fertile groups refuse to breed, and some in
  the most sterile groups breed freely. Those animals which usually breed
  freely under confinement, rarely breed, as I was assured, in the
  Zoological Gardens, within a year or two after their first importation.
  When an animal which is generally sterile under confinement happens to
  breed, the young apparently do not inherit this power; for had this been
  the case, various quadrupeds and birds, which are valuable for
  exhibition, would have become common. Dr. Broca even affirms<a
  name="NtA_385" href="#Nt_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a> that many animals in
  the Jardin des Plantes, after having produced young for three or four
  successive generations, become sterile; but this may be the result of too
  close interbreeding. It is a remarkable circumstance that many mammals
  and birds have produced hybrids under confinement quite as readily as, or
  even more readily than, they have procreated their own kind. Of this fact
  many instances have been given;<a name="NtA_386"
  href="#Nt_386"><sup>[386]</sup></a> and we are thus reminded of those
  plants which when cultivated refuse to be fertilised by their own pollen,
  but can easily be fertilised by that of a distinct species. Finally, we
  must conclude, limited as the conclusion is, that changed conditions of
  life have an especial power of acting injuriously on the reproductive
  system. The whole case is quite peculiar, for these organs, though not
  diseased, are thus rendered incapable of performing their proper
  functions, or perform them imperfectly.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>Sterility of Domesticated Animals from changed
  conditions.</i>&mdash;With respect to domesticated animals, as their
  domestication mainly depends on the accident of their breeding freely
  under captivity, we ought not to expect that their reproductive system
  would be affected by any moderate degree of change. Those orders of
  quadrupeds and birds, of which the wild species breed most readily in our
  menageries, have afforded us the greatest number of domesticated
  productions. Savages in most parts of the world are fond of taming
  animals;<a name="NtA_387" href="#Nt_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a> and if any
  of these regularly produced <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page161"></a>{161}</span>young, and were at the same time useful,
  they would be at once domesticated. If, when their masters migrated into
  other countries, they were in addition found capable of withstanding
  various climates, they would be still more valuable; and it appears that
  the animals which breed readily in captivity can generally withstand
  different climates. Some few domesticated animals, such as the reindeer
  and camel, offer an exception to this rule. Many of our domesticated
  animals can bear with undiminished fertility the most unnatural
  conditions; for instance, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and ferrets breed in
  miserably confined hutches. Few European dogs of any kind withstand
  without degeneration the climate of India; but as long as they survive,
  they retain, as I hear from Mr. Falconer, their fertility; so it is,
  according to Dr. Daniell, with English dogs taken to Sierra Leone. The
  fowl, a native of the hot jungles of India, becomes more fertile than its
  parent-stock in every quarter of the world, until we advance as far north
  as Greenland and Northern Siberia, where this bird will not breed. Both
  fowls and pigeons, which I received during the autumn direct from Sierra
  Leone, were at once ready to couple.<a name="NtA_388"
  href="#Nt_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a> I have, also, seen pigeons breeding
  as freely as the common kinds within a year after their importation from
  the Upper Nile. The guinea-fowl, an aboriginal of the hot and dry deserts
  of Africa, whilst living under our damp and cool climate, produces a
  large supply of eggs.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, our domesticated animals under new conditions
  occasionally show signs of lessened fertility. Roulin asserts that in the
  hot valleys of the equatorial Cordillera sheep are not fully fecund;<a
  name="NtA_389" href="#Nt_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a> and according to Lord
  Somerville,<a name="NtA_390" href="#Nt_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> the
  merino-sheep which he imported from Spain were not at first perfectly
  fertile. It is said<a name="NtA_391" href="#Nt_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a>
  that mares brought up on dry food in the stable, and turned out to grass,
  do not at first breed. The peahen, as we have seen, is said not to lay so
  many eggs in England as in India. It was long before the canary-bird was
  fully fertile, and even now first-rate breeding birds are not common.<a
  name="NtA_392" href="#Nt_392"><sup>[392]</sup></a> In the hot and dry
  province of Delhi, the eggs of the turkey, as I hear from Dr. Falconer,
  though placed under a hen, are extremely liable to fail. According to
  Roulin, geese taken within a recent period to the lofty plateau of
  Bogota, at first laid seldom, and then only a few eggs; of these scarcely
  a fourth were hatched, and half the young birds died: in the second
  generation they were more fertile; and when Roulin wrote they were
  becoming as <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>{162}</span>fertile as our geese in Europe. In the
  Philippine Archipelago the goose, it is asserted, will not breed or even
  lay eggs.<a name="NtA_393" href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a> A more
  curious case is that of the fowl, which, according to Roulin, when first
  introduced would not breed at Cusco in Bolivia, but subsequently became
  quite fertile; and the English Game fowl, lately introduced, had not as
  yet arrived a its full fertility, for to raise two or three chickens from
  a nest of eggs was thought fortunate. In Europe close confinement has a
  marked effect on the fertility of the fowl: it has been found in France
  that with fowls allowed considerable freedom only twenty per cent. of the
  eggs failed; when allowed less freedom forty per cent. failed; and in
  close confinement sixty out of the hundred were not hatched.<a
  name="NtA_394" href="#Nt_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> So we see that
  unnatural and changed conditions of life produce some effect on the
  fertility of our most thoroughly domesticated animals, in the same
  manner, though in a far less degree, as with captive wild animals.</p>

  <p>It is by no means rare to find certain males and females which will
  not breed together, though both are known to be perfectly fertile with
  other males and females. We have no reason to suppose that this is caused
  by these animals having been subjected to any change in their habits of
  life; therefore such cases are hardly related to our present subject. The
  cause apparently lies in an innate sexual incompatibility of the pair
  which are matched. Several instances have been communicated to me by Mr.
  W.&nbsp;C. Spooner (well known for his essay on Cross-breeding), by Mr. Eyton
  of Eyton, by Mr. Wicksted and othe breeders, and especially by Mr. Waring
  of Chelsfield, in relation to horses, cattle, pigs, foxhounds, other
  dogs, and pigeons.<a name="NtA_395" href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a>
  In these cases, females, which either previously or subsequently were
  proved to be fertile, failed to breed with certain males, with whom it
  was particularly desired to match them. A change in the constitution of
  the female may sometimes have occurred before she was put to the second
  male; but in other cases this explanation is hardly tenable, for a
  female, known not to be barren, has been unsuccessfully paired seven or
  eight times with the same male likewise known to be perfectly fertile.
  With cart-mares, which sometimes will not breed with stallions of pure
  blood, but subsequently have bred with cart-stallions, Mr. Spooner is
  inclined to attribute the failure to the lesser sexual power of the
  race-horse. But I have heard from the greatest breeder of race-horses at
  the present day, through Mr. Waring, that "it frequently occurs with a
  mare to be put several times during one or two seasons to a particular
  stallion of acknowledged power, and yet prove barren; the mare afterwards
  breeding at once with some other horse." These facts are worth recording,
  as they show, like so many previous facts, on what slight constitutional
  differences the fertility of an animal often depends.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Sterility of Plants from changed Conditions of Life, and from
other causes.</i></p>

  <p>In the vegetable kingdom cases of sterility frequently occur,
  analogous with those previously given in the animal kingdom. But the
  subject is obscured by several circumstances, presently to be discussed,
  namely, the contabescence of the anthers, as Gärtner has named a certain
  affection&mdash;monstrosities&mdash;doubleness of the
  flower&mdash;much-enlarged fruit&mdash;and long-continued or excessive
  propagation by buds.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It is notorious that many plants in our gardens and hot-houses, though
  preserved in the most perfect health, rarely or never produce seed. I do
  not allude to plants which run to leaves, from being kept too damp, or
  too warm, or too much manured; for these do not produce the reproductive
  individual or flower, and the case may be wholly different. Nor do I
  allude to fruit not ripening from want of heat, or rotting from too much
  moisture. But many exotic plants, with their ovules and pollen appearing
  perfectly sound, will not set any seed. The sterility in many cases, as I
  know from my own observation, is simply due to the absence of the proper
  insects for carrying the pollen to the stigma. But after excluding the
  several cases just specified, there are many plants in which the
  reproductive system has been seriously affected by the altered conditions
  of life to which they have been subjected.</p>

  <p>It would be tedious to enter on many details. Linnæus long ago
  observed<a name="NtA_396" href="#Nt_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> that Alpine
  plants, although naturally laded with seed, produce either few or none
  when cultivated in gardens. But exceptions often occur: the <i>Draba
  sylvestris</i>, one of our most thoroughly Alpine plants, multiplies
  itself by seed in Mr. H.&nbsp;C. Watson's garden, near London; and Kerner, who
  has particularly attended to the cultivation of Alpine plants, found that
  various kinds, when cultivated, spontaneously sowed themselves.<a
  name="NtA_397" href="#Nt_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a> Many plants which
  naturally grow in peat-earth are entirely sterile in our gardens. I have
  noticed the same fact with several liliaceous plants, which nevertheless
  grew vigorously.</p>

  <p>Too much manure renders some kinds utterly sterile, as I have myself
  observed. The tendency to sterility from this cause runs in families;
  thus, according to Gärtner,<a name="NtA_398"
  href="#Nt_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> it is hardly possible to give too
  much manure to most Gramineæ, Cruciferæ, and Leguminosæ, whilst succulent
  and bulbous-rooted plants are easily affected. Extreme poverty of soil is
  less <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>{164}</span>apt to induce sterility; but dwarfed
  plants of <i>Trifolium minus</i> and <i>repens</i>, growing on a lawn
  often mown and never manured, did not produce any seed. The temperature
  of the soil, and the season at which plants are watered, often have a
  marked effect on their fertility, as was observed by Kölreuter in the
  case of Mirabilis.<a name="NtA_399" href="#Nt_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a>
  Mr. Scott in the Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh observed that <i>Oncidium
  divaricatum</i> would not set seed when grown in a basket in which it
  throve, but was capable of fertilisation in a pot where it was a little
  damper. <i>Pelargonium fulgidum</i>, for many years after its
  introduction, seeded freely; it then became sterile; now it is fertile<a
  name="NtA_400" href="#Nt_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a> if kept in a dry stove
  during the winter. Other varieties of pelargonium are sterile and others
  fertile without our being able to assign any cause. Very slight changes
  in the position of a plant, whether planted on a bank or at its base,
  sometimes make all the difference in its producing seed. Temperature
  apparently has a much more powerful influence on the fertility of plants
  than on that of animals. Nevertheless it is wonderful what changes some
  few plants will withstand with undiminished fertility: thus the
  <i>Zephyranthes candida</i>, a native of the moderately warm banks of the
  Plata, sows itself in the hot dry country near Lima, and in Yorkshire
  resists the severest frosts, and I have seen seeds gathered from pods
  which had been covered with snow during three weeks.<a name="NtA_401"
  href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> <i>Berberis Wallichii</i>, from the
  hot Khasia range in India, is uninjured by our sharpest frosts, and
  ripens its fruit under our cool summers. Nevertheless I presume we must
  attribute to change of climate the sterility of many foreign plants; thus
  the Persian and Chinese lilacs (<i>Syringa Persica</i> and
  <i>Chinensis</i>), though perfectly hardly, never here produce a seed;
  the common lilac (<i>S. vulgaris</i>) seeds with us moderately well, but
  in parts of Germany the capsules never contain seed.<a name="NtA_402"
  href="#Nt_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Some of the cases, given in the last chapter, of self-impotent plants,
  which are fertile both on the male and female side when united with
  distinct individuals or species, might have been here introduced; for as
  this peculiar form of sterility generally occurs with exotic plants or
  with endemic plants cultivated in pots, and as it disappeared in the
  <i>Passiflora alata</i> when grafted, we may conclude that in these cases
  it is the result of the treatment to which the plants or their parents
  have been exposed.</p>

  <p>The liability of plants to be affected in their fertility by slightly
  changed conditions is the more remarkable, as the pollen when once in
  process of formation is not easily injured; a plant may be transplanted,
  or a branch with flower-buds be cut off and placed in water, and the
  pollen will be matured. Pollen, also, when once mature, may be kept for
  weeks or even months.<a name="NtA_403"
  href="#Nt_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a> The female organs are more sensitive,
  for Gärtner<a name="NtA_404" href="#Nt_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a> found
  that dicotyledonous plants, when carefully removed so that they did not
  in the least flag, could seldom be fertilised; this occurred even with
  potted <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page165"></a>{165}</span>plants if the roots had grown out of the
  hole at the bottom. In some few cases, however, as with Digitalis,
  transplantation did not prevent fertilisation; and according to the
  testimony of Mawz, <i>Brassica rapa</i>, when pulled up by its roots and
  placed in water, ripened its seed. Flower-stems of several
  monocotyledonous plants when cut off and placed in water likewise produce
  seed. But in these cases I presume that the flowers had been already
  fertilised, for Herbert<a name="NtA_405"
  href="#Nt_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> found with the Crocus that the plants
  might be removed or mutilated after the act of fertilisation, and would
  still perfect their seeds; but that, if transplanted before being
  fertilised, the application of pollen was powerless.</p>

  <p>Plants which have been long cultivated can generally endure with
  undiminished fertility various and great changes; but not in most cases
  so great a change of climate as domesticated animals. It is remarkable
  that many plants under these circumstances are so much affected that the
  proportions and the nature of their chemical ingredients are modified,
  yet their fertility is unimpaired. Thus, as Dr. Falconer informs me,
  there is a great difference in the character of the fibre in hemp, in the
  quantity of oil in the seed of the Linum, in the proportion of narcotin
  to morphine in the poppy, in gluten to starch in wheat, when these plants
  are cultivated on the plains and on the mountains of India; nevertheless,
  they all remain fully fertile.</p>

  <p><i>Contabescence.</i>&mdash;Gärtner has designated by this term a
  peculiar condition of the anthers in certain plants, in which they are
  shrivelled, or become brown and tough, and contain no good pollen. When
  in this state they exactly resemble the anthers of the most sterile
  hybrids. Gärtner,<a name="NtA_406" href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> in
  his discussion on this subject, has shown that plants of many orders are
  occasionally thus affected; but the Caryophyllaceæ and Liliaceæ suffer
  most, and to these orders, I think, the Ericaceæ may be added.
  Contabescence varies in degree, but on the same plant all the flowers are
  generally affected to nearly the same extent. The anthers are affected at
  a very early period in the flower-bud, and remain in the same state (with
  one recorded exception) during the life of the plant. The affection
  cannot be cured by any change of treatment, and is propagated by layers,
  cuttings, &amp;c., and perhaps even by seed. In contabescent plants the
  female organs are seldom affected, or merely become precocious in their
  development. The cause of this affection is doubtful, and is different in
  different cases. Until I read Gärtner's discussion I attributed it, as
  apparently did Herbert, to the unnatural treatment of the plants; but its
  permanence under changed conditions, and the female organs not being
  affected, seem incompatible with this view. The fact of several endemic
  plants becoming contabescent in our gardens seems, at first sight,
  equally incompatible with this view; but Kölreuter believes that this is
  the result of their transplantation. The contabescent plants of Dianthus
  and Verbascum, found wild by Wiegmann, grew on a dry and sterile bank.
  The fact that exotic <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>{166}</span>plants are eminently liable to this
  affection also seems to show that it is in some manner caused by their
  unnatural treatment. In some instances, as with Silene, Gärtner's view
  seems the most probable, namely, that it is caused by an inherent
  tendency in the species to become di&oelig;cious. I can add another
  cause, namely, the illegitimate unions of reciprocally dimorphic or
  trimorphic plants, for I have observed seedlings of three species of
  Primula and of <i>Lythrum salicaria</i>, which had been raised from
  plants illegitimately fertilised by their own-form pollen, with some or
  all their anthers in a contabescent state. There is perhaps an additional
  cause, namely, self-fertilisation; for many plants of Dianthus and
  Lobelia, which had been raised from self-fertilised seeds, had their
  anthers in this state; but these instances are not conclusive, as both
  genera are liable from other causes to this affection.</p>

  <p>Cases of an opposite nature likewise occur, namely, plants with the
  female organs struck with sterility, whilst the male organs remain
  perfect. <i>Dianthus Japonicus</i>, a Passiflora, and Nicotiana, have
  been described by Gärtner<a name="NtA_407"
  href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a> as being in this unusual
  condition.</p>

  <p><i>Monstrosities as a cause of Sterility.</i>&mdash;Great deviations
  of structure, even when the reproductive organs themselves are not
  seriously affected, sometimes cause plants to become sterile. But in
  other cases plants may become monstrous to an extreme degree and yet
  retain their full fertility. Gallesio, who certainly had great
  experience,<a name="NtA_408" href="#Nt_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a> often
  attributes sterility to this cause; but it may be suspected that in some
  of his cases sterility was the cause, and not the result, of the
  monstrous growths. The curious St. Valery apple, although it bears fruit,
  rarely produces seed. The wonderfully anomalous flowers of <i>Begonia
  frigida</i>, formerly described, though they appear fit for
  fructification, are sterile.<a name="NtA_409"
  href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a> Species of Primulæ, in which the
  calyx is brightly coloured, are said<a name="NtA_410"
  href="#Nt_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a> to be often sterile, though I have
  known them to be fertile. On the other hand, Verlot gives several cases
  of proliferous flowers which can be propagated by seed. This was the case
  with a poppy, which had become monopetalous by the union of its petals.<a
  name="NtA_411" href="#Nt_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a> Another extraordinary
  poppy, with the stamens replaced by numerous small supplementary
  capsules, likewise reproduces itself by seed. This has also occurred with
  a plant of <i>Saxifraga geum</i>, in which a series of adventitious
  carpels, bearing ovules on their margins, had been developed between the
  stamens and the normal carpels.<a name="NtA_412"
  href="#Nt_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a> Lastly, with respect to peloric
  flowers, which depart wonderfully from the natural structure,&mdash;those
  of <i>Linaria vulgaris</i> seem generally to be more or less sterile,
  whilst those before described of <i>Antirrhinum majus</i>, when
  artificially fertilised with their own pollen, are perfectly <!-- Page
  167 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>{167}</span>fertile,
  though sterile when left to themselves, for bees are unable to crawl into
  the narrow tubular flower. The peloric flowers of <i>Corydalis
  solida</i>, according to Godron,<a name="NtA_413"
  href="#Nt_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a> are barren; whilst those of Gloxinia
  are well known to yield plenty of seed. In our greenhouse Pelargoniums,
  the central flower of the truss is often peloric, and Mr. Masters informs
  me that he tried in vain during several years to get seed from these
  flowers. I likewise made many vain attempts, but sometimes succeeded in
  fertilising them with pollen from a normal flower of another variety; and
  conversely I several times fertilised ordinary flowers with peloric
  pollen. Only once I succeeded in raising a plant from a peloric flower
  fertilised by pollen from a peloric flower borne by another variety; but
  the plant, it may be added, presented nothing particular in its
  structure. Hence we may conclude that no general rule can be laid down;
  but any great deviation from the normal structure, even when the
  reproductive organs themselves are not seriously affected, certainly
  often leads to sexual impotence.</p>

  <p><i>Double Flowers.</i>&mdash;When the stamens are converted into
  petals, the plant becomes on the male side sterile; when both stamens and
  pistils are thus changed, the plant becomes completely barren.
  Symmetrical flowers having numerous stamens and petals are the most
  liable to become double, as perhaps follows from all multiple organs
  being the most subject to variability. But flowers furnished with only a
  few stamens, and others which are asymmetrical in structure, sometimes
  become double, as we see with the double gorse or Ulex, Petunia, and
  Antirrhinum. The Compositæ bear what are called double flowers by the
  abnormal development of the corolla of their central florets. Doubleness
  is sometimes connected with prolification,<a name="NtA_414"
  href="#Nt_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a> or the continued growth of the axis
  of the flower. Doubleness is strongly inherited. No one has produced, as
  Lindley remarks,<a name="NtA_415" href="#Nt_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a>
  double flowers by promoting the perfect health of the plant. On the
  contrary, unnatural conditions of life favour their production. There is
  some reason to believe that seeds kept during many years, and seeds
  believed to be imperfectly fertilised, yield double flowers more freely
  than fresh and perfectly fertilised seed.<a name="NtA_416"
  href="#Nt_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a> Long-continued cultivation in rich
  soil seems to be the commonest exciting cause. A double narcissus and a
  double <i>Anthemis nobilis</i>, transplanted into very poor soil, have
  been observed to become single;<a name="NtA_417"
  href="#Nt_417"><sup>[417]</sup></a> and I have seen a completely double
  white primrose rendered permanently single by being divided and
  transplanted whilst in full flower. It has been observed by Professor
  Morren that doubleness of the flowers and variegation of the leaves are
  antagonistic states; but so many exceptions to the rule have lately been
  recorded,<a name="NtA_418" href="#Nt_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a> that,
  though general, it cannot be looked at as invariable. <!-- Page 168
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>{168}</span>Variegation
  seems generally to result from a feeble or atrophied condition of the
  plant, and a large proportion of the seedlings raised from parents both
  of which are variegated usually perish at an early age; hence we may
  perhaps infer that doubleness, which is the antagonistic state, commonly
  arises from a plethoric condition. On the other hand, extremely poor soil
  sometimes, though rarely, appears to cause doubleness: I formerly
  described<a name="NtA_419" href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> some
  completely double, bud-like, flowers produced in large numbers by stunted
  wild plants of <i>Gentiana amarella</i> growing on a poor chalky bank. I
  have also noticed a distinct tendency to doubleness in the flowers of a
  Ranunculus, Horse-chesnut, and Bladder-nut (<i>Ranunculus repens</i>,
  <i><span class="correction" title="Original reads `&OElig;sculus', corrected by errata, page viii."
  >Æsculus</span> pavia</i>, and <i>Staphylea</i>), growing under very
  unfavourable conditions. Professor Lehman<a name="NtA_420"
  href="#Nt_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a> found several wild plants growing
  near a hot spring with double flowers. With respect to the cause of
  doubleness, which arises, as we see, under widely different
  circumstances, I shall presently attempt to show that the most probable
  view is that unnatural conditions first give a tendency to sterility, and
  that then, on the principle of compensation, as the reproductive organs
  do not perform their proper functions, they either become developed into
  petals, or additional petals are formed. This view has lately been
  supported by Mr. Laxton,<a name="NtA_421"
  href="#Nt_421"><sup>[421]</sup></a> who advances the case of some common
  peas, which, after long-continued heavy rain, flowered a second time, and
  produced double flowers.</p>

  <p><i>Seedless Fruit.</i>&mdash;Many of our most valuable fruits,
  although consisting in a homological sense of widely different organs,
  are either quite sterile, or produce extremely few seeds. This is
  notoriously the case with our best pears, grapes, and figs, with the
  pine-apple, banana, bread-fruit, pomegranate, azarole, date-palms, and
  some members of the orange-tribe. Poorer varieties of these same fruits
  either habitually or occasionally yield seed.<a name="NtA_422"
  href="#Nt_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a> Most horticulturists look at the
  great size and anomalous development of the fruit as the cause, and
  sterility as the result; but the opposite view, as we shall presently
  see, is more probable.</p>

  <p><i>Sterility from the excessive development of the Organs of Growth or
  Vegetation.</i>&mdash;Plants which from any cause grow too luxuriantly,
  and produce leaves, stems, runners, suckers, tubers, bulbs, &amp;c., in
  excess, sometimes do not flower, or if they flower do not yield seed. To
  make European vegetables under the hot climate of India yield seed, it is
  necessary to check their growth; and, when one-third grown, they are
  taken up, and their stems and <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page169"></a>{169}</span>tap-roots are cut or mutilated.<a
  name="NtA_423" href="#Nt_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a> So it is with hybrids;
  for instance, Prof. Lecoq<a name="NtA_424"
  href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> had three plants of Mirabilis, which,
  though they grew luxuriantly and flowered, were quite sterile; but after
  beating one with a stick until a few branches alone were left, these at
  once yielded good seed. The sugar-cane, which grows vigorously and
  produces a large supply of succulent stems, never, according to various
  observers, bears seed in the West Indies, Malaga, India, Cochin China, or
  the Malay Archipelago.<a name="NtA_425"
  href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a> Plants which produce a large number
  of tubers are apt to be sterile, as occurs, to a certain extent, with the
  common potato; and Mr. Fortune informs me that the sweet potato
  (<i>Convolvulus batatas</i>) in China never, as far as he has seen,
  yields seed. Dr. Royle remarks<a name="NtA_426"
  href="#Nt_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> that in India the <i>Agave
  vivipara</i>, when grown in rich soil, invariably produces bulbs, but no
  seeds; whilst a poor soil and dry climate leads to an opposite result. In
  China, according to Mr. Fortune, an extraordinary number of little bulbs
  are developed in the axils of the leaves of the yam, and this plant does
  not bear seed. Whether in these cases, as in those of double flowers and
  seedless fruit, sexual sterility from changed conditions of life is the
  primary cause which leads to the excessive development of the organs of
  vegetation, is doubtful; though some evidence might be advanced in favour
  of this view. It is perhaps a more probable view that plants which
  propagate themselves largely by one method, namely by buds, have not
  sufficient vital power or organised matter for the other method of sexual
  generation.</p>

  <p>Several distinguished botanists and good practical judges believe that
  long-continued propagation by cuttings, runners, tubers, bulbs, &amp;c.,
  independently of any excessive development of these parts, is the cause
  of many plants failing to produce flowers and of others failing to
  produce fertile flowers,&mdash;it is as if they had lost the habit of
  sexual generation.<a name="NtA_427" href="#Nt_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a>
  That many plants when thus propagated are sterile there can be no doubt,
  but whether the long continuance of this form of propagation is the
  actual cause of their sterility, I will not venture, from the want of
  sufficient evidence, to express an opinion.</p>

  <p>That plants may be propagated for long periods by buds, without the
  aid of sexual generation, we may safely infer from this being the case
  with many plants which must have long survived in a state of nature. As I
  have had occasion before to allude to this subject, I will here give such
  cases as I have collected. Many alpine plants ascend mountains beyond the
  height at which they can produce seed.<a name="NtA_428"
  href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> Certain species of <!-- Page 170
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>{170}</span>Poa and
  Festuca, when growing on mountain-pastures, propagate themselves, as I
  hear from Mr. Bentham, almost exclusively by bulblets. Kalm gives a more
  curious instance<a name="NtA_429" href="#Nt_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a> of
  several American trees, which grow so plentifully in marshes or in thick
  woods, that they are certainly well adapted for these stations, yet
  scarcely ever produce seeds; but when accidentally growing on the outside
  of the marsh or wood, are loaded with seed. The common ivy is found in
  Northern Sweden and Russia, but flowers and fruits only in the southern
  provinces. The <i>Acorus calamus</i> extends over a large portion of the
  globe, but so rarely perfects its fruit that this has been seen but by
  few botanists.<a name="NtA_430" href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a> The
  <i>Hypericum calycinum</i>, which propagates itself so freely in our
  shrubberies by rhizomas and is naturalised in Ireland, blossoms
  profusely, but sets no seed; nor did it set any when fertilised in my
  garden by pollen from plants growing at a distance. The <i>Lysimachia
  nummularia</i>, which is furnished with long runners, so seldom produces
  seed-capsules, that Prof. Decaisne,<a name="NtA_431"
  href="#Nt_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a> who has especially attended to this
  plant, has never seen it in fruit. The <i>Carex rigida</i> often fails to
  perfect its seed in Scotland, Lapland, Greenland, Germany, and New
  Hampshire in the United States.<a name="NtA_432"
  href="#Nt_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a> The periwinkle (<i>Vinca minor</i>),
  which spreads largely by runners, is said scarcely ever to produce fruit
  in England;<a name="NtA_433" href="#Nt_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a> but this
  plant requires insect-aid for its fertilisation, and the proper insects
  may be absent or rare. The <i>Jussiæa grandiflora</i> has become
  naturalised in Southern France, and has spread by its rhizomas so
  extensively as to impede the navigation of the waters, but never produces
  fertile seed.<a name="NtA_434" href="#Nt_434"><sup>[434]</sup></a> The
  horse-radish (<i>Cochlearia armoracia</i>) spreads pertinaciously and is
  naturalised in various parts of Europe; though it bears flowers, these
  rarely produce capsules: Professor Caspary also informs me that he has
  watched this plant since 1851, but has never seen its fruit; nor is this
  surprising, as he finds scarcely a grain of good pollen. The common
  little <i>Ranunculus ficaria</i> rarely, and some say never, bears seed
  in England, France, or Switzerland; but in 1863 I observed seeds on
  several plants growing near my house. According to M. Chatin, there are
  two forms of this Ranunculus; and it is the bulbiferous form which does
  not yield seed from producing no pollen.<a name="NtA_435"
  href="#Nt_435"><sup>[435]</sup></a> Other cases <!-- Page 171 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span>analogous with the
  foregoing could be given; for instance, some kinds of mosses and lichens
  have never been seen to fructify in France.</p>

  <p>Some of these endemic and naturalised plants are probably rendered
  sterile from excessive multiplication by buds, and their consequent
  incapacity to produce and nourish seed. But the sterility of others more
  probably depends on the peculiar conditions under which they live, as in
  the case of the ivy in the northern parts of Europe, and of the trees in
  the swamps of the United States; yet these plants must be in some
  respects eminently well adapted for the stations which they occupy, for
  they hold their places against a host of competitors.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Finally, when we reflect on the sterility which accompanies the
  doubling of flowers,&mdash;the excessive development of fruit,&mdash;and
  a great increase in the organs of vegetation, we must bear in mind that
  the whole effect has seldom been caused at once. An incipient tendency is
  observed, and continued selection completes the work, as is known to be
  the case with our double flowers and best fruits. The view which seems
  the most probable, and which connects together all the foregoing facts
  and brings them within our present subject, is, that changed and
  unnatural conditions of life first give a tendency to sterility; and in
  consequence of this, the organs of reproduction being no longer able
  fully to perform their proper functions, a supply of organised matter,
  not required for the development of the seed, flows either into these
  same organs and renders them foliaceous, or into the fruit, stems,
  tubers, &amp;c., increasing their size and succulency. But I am far from
  wishing to deny that there exists, independently of any incipient
  sterility, an antagonism between the two forms of reproduction, namely,
  by seed and by buds, when either is carried to an extreme degree. That
  incipient sterility plays an important part in the doubling of flowers,
  and in the other cases just specified, I infer chiefly from the following
  facts. When fertility is lost from a wholly different cause, namely, from
  hybridism, there is a strong tendency, as Gärtner<a name="NtA_436"
  href="#Nt_436"><sup>[436]</sup></a> affirms, for flowers to become
  double, and this tendency is inherited. Moreover it is notorious that
  with hybrids the male organs become sterile before the female organs, and
  with double flowers the stamens first become <!-- Page 172 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>{172}</span>foliaceous. This latter
  fact is well shown by the male flowers of di&oelig;cious plants, which,
  according to Gallesio,<a name="NtA_437"
  href="#Nt_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a> first become double. Again, Gärtner<a
  name="NtA_438" href="#Nt_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a> often insists that the
  flowers of even utterly sterile hybrids, which do not produce any seed,
  generally yield perfect capsules or fruit,&mdash;a fact which has
  likewise been repeatedly observed by Naudin with the Cucurbitaceæ; so
  that the production of fruit by plants rendered sterile through any other
  and distinct cause is intelligible. Kölreuter has also expressed his
  unbounded astonishment at the size and development of the tubers in
  certain hybrids; and all experimentalists<a name="NtA_439"
  href="#Nt_439"><sup>[439]</sup></a> have remarked on the strong tendency
  in hybrids to increase by roots, runners, and suckers. Seeing that hybrid
  plants, which from their nature are more or less sterile, thus tend to
  produce double flowers; that they have the parts including the seed, that
  is the fruit, perfectly developed, even when containing no seed; that
  they sometimes yield gigantic roots; that they almost invariably tend to
  increase largely by suckers and other such means;&mdash;seeing this, and
  knowing, from the many facts given in the earlier parts of this chapter,
  that almost all organic beings when exposed to unnatural conditions tend
  to become more or less sterile, it seems much the most probable view that
  with cultivated plants sterility is the exciting cause, and double
  flowers, rich seedless fruit, and in some cases largely-developed organs
  of vegetation, &amp;c., are the indirect results&mdash;these results
  having been in most cases largely increased through continued selection
  by man.</p>

  <p>It was shown in the fifteenth chapter that when individuals of the
  same variety, or even of a distinct variety, are allowed freely to
  intercross, uniformity of character is ultimately acquired. Some few
  characters, however, are incapable of fusion, but these are unimportant,
  as they are almost always of a semi-monstrous nature, and have suddenly
  appeared. Hence, to preserve our domesticated breeds true, or to improve
  them by methodical selection, it is obviously necessary that they should
  be kept separate. Nevertheless, through unconscious selection, a whole
  body of individuals may be slowly modified, as we shall see in a future
  chapter, without separating them into distinct lots. Domestic races have
  often been intentionally modified by one or two crosses, made with some
  allied race, and occasionally even by repeated crosses with very distinct
  races; but in almost all such cases, long-continued and careful selection
  has been absolutely necessary, owing to the excessive variability of the
  crossed offspring, due to the principle of reversion. In a few instances,
  however, mongrels have retained a uniform character from their first
  production.</p>

  <p>When two varieties are allowed to cross freely, and one is <!-- Page
  174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>{174}</span>much more
  numerous than the other, the former will ultimately absorb the latter.
  Should both varieties exist in nearly equal numbers, it is probable that
  a considerable period would elapse before the acquirement of a uniform
  character; and the character ultimately acquired would largely depend on
  prepotency of transmission, and on the conditions of life; for the nature
  of these conditions would generally favour one variety more than another,
  so that a kind of natural selection would come into play. Unless the
  crossed offspring were slaughtered by man without the least
  discrimination, some degree of unmethodical selection would likewise come
  into action. From these several considerations we may infer, that when
  two or more closely allied species first came into the possession of the
  same tribe, their crossing will not have influenced, in so great a degree
  as has often been supposed, the character of the offspring in future
  times; although in some cases it probably has had a considerable
  effect.</p>

  <p>Domestication, as a general rule, increases the prolificness of
  animals and plants. It eliminates the tendency to sterility which is
  common to species when first taken from a state of nature and crossed. On
  this latter head we have no direct evidence; but as our races of dogs,
  cattle, pigs, &amp;c., are almost certainly descended from aboriginally
  distinct stocks, and as these races are now fully fertile together, or at
  least incomparably more fertile than most species when crossed, we may
  with much confidence accept this conclusion.</p>

  <p>Abundant evidence has been given that crossing adds to the size,
  vigour, and fertility of the offspring. This holds good when there has
  been no previous close interbreeding. It applies to the individuals of
  the same variety but belonging to different families, to distinct
  varieties, sub-species, and partially even to species. In the latter
  case, though size is often gained, fertility is lost; but the increased
  size, vigour, and hardiness of many hybrids cannot be accounted for
  solely on the principle of compensation from the inaction of the
  reproductive system. Certain plants, both of pure and hybrid origin,
  though perfectly healthy, have become self-impotent, apparently from the
  unnatural conditions to which they have been exposed; and such plants, as
  well as others in their normal state, can be stimulated to <!-- Page 175
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>{175}</span>fertility only
  by crossing them with other individuals of the same species or even of a
  distinct species.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, long-continued close interbreeding between the
  nearest relations diminishes the constitutional vigour, size, and
  fertility of the offspring; and occasionally leads to malformations, but
  not necessarily to general deterioration of form or structure. This
  failure of fertility shows that the evil results of interbreeding are
  independent of the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both
  parents, though this augmentation no doubt is often highly injurious. Our
  belief that evil follows from close interbreeding rests to a large extent
  on the experience of practical breeders, especially of those who have
  reared many animals of the kinds which can be propagated quickly; but it
  likewise rests on several carefully recorded experiments. With some
  animals close interbreeding may be carried on for a long period with
  impunity by the selection of the most vigorous and healthy individuals;
  but sooner or later evil follows. The evil, however, comes on so slowly
  and gradually that it easily escapes observation, but can be recognised
  by the almost instantaneous manner in which size, constitutional vigour,
  and fertility are regained when animals that have long been interbred are
  crossed with a distinct family.</p>

  <p>These two great classes of facts, namely, the good derived from
  crossing, and the evil from close interbreeding, with the consideration
  of the innumerable adaptations throughout nature for compelling, or
  favouring, or at least permitting, the occasional union of distinct
  individuals, taken together, lead to the conclusion that it is a law of
  nature that organic beings shall not fertilise themselves for perpetuity.
  This law was first plainly hinted at in 1799, with respect to plants, by
  Andrew Knight,<a name="NtA_440" href="#Nt_440"><sup>[440]</sup></a> and,
  not long afterwards, that sagacious observer Kölreuter, after showing how
  well the Malvaceæ are adapted for <!-- Page 176 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>{176}</span>crossing, asks, "an id
  aliquid in recessu habeat, quod hujuscemodi flores nunquam proprio suo
  pulvere, sed semper eo aliarum suæ speciei impregnentur, merito quæritur?
  Certe natura nil facit frustra." Although we may demur to Kölreuter's
  saying that nature does nothing in vain, seeing how many organic beings
  retain rudimentary and useless organs, yet undoubtedly the argument from
  the innumerable contrivances, which favour the crossing of distinct
  individuals of the same species, is of the greatest weight. The most
  important result of this law is that it leads to uniformity of character
  in the individuals of the same species. In the case of certain
  hermaphrodites, which probably intercross only at long intervals of time,
  and with unisexual animals inhabiting somewhat separated localities,
  which can only occasionally come into contact and pair, the greater
  vigour and fertility of the crossed offspring will ultimately prevail in
  giving uniformity of character to the individuals of the same species.
  But when we go beyond the limits of the same species, free intercrossing
  is barred by the law of sterility.</p>

  <p>In searching for facts which might throw light on the cause of the
  good effects from crossing, and of the evil effects from close
  interbreeding, we have seen that, on the one hand, it is a widely
  prevalent and ancient belief that animals and plants profit from slight
  changes in their condition of life; and it would appear that the germ, in
  a somewhat analogous manner, is more effectually stimulated by the male
  element, when taken from a distinct individual, and therefore slightly
  modified in nature, than when taken from a male having the same identical
  constitution. On the other hand, numerous facts have been given, showing
  that when animals are first subjected to captivity, even in their native
  land, and although allowed much liberty, their reproductive functions are
  often greatly impaired or quite annulled. Some groups of animals are more
  affected than others, but with apparently capricious exceptions in every
  group. Some animals never or rarely couple: some couple freely, but never
  or rarely conceive. The secondary male characters, the maternal functions
  and instincts, are occasionally affected. With plants, when first
  subjected to cultivation, analogous facts have been observed. We probably
  owe our double flowers, rich seedless <!-- Page 177 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>{177}</span>fruits, and in some
  cases greatly developed tubers, &amp;c., to incipient sterility of the
  above nature combined with a copious supply of nutriment. Animals which
  have long been domesticated, and plants which have long been cultivated,
  can generally withstand with unimpaired fertility great changes in their
  conditions of life; though both are sometimes slightly affected. With
  animals the somewhat rare capacity of breeding freely under confinement
  has mainly determined, together with their utility, the kinds which have
  been domesticated.</p>

  <p>We can in no case precisely say what is the cause of the diminished
  fertility of an animal when first captured, or of a plant when first
  cultivated; we can only infer that it is caused by a change of some kind
  in the natural conditions of life. The remarkable susceptibility of the
  reproductive system to such changes,&mdash;a susceptibility not common to
  any other organ,&mdash;apparently has an important bearing on
  Variability, as we shall see in a future chapter.</p>

  <p>It is impossible not to be struck with the double parallelism between
  the two classes of facts just alluded to. On the one hand, slight changes
  in the conditions of life, and crosses between slightly modified forms or
  varieties, are beneficial as far as prolificness and constitutional
  vigour are concerned. On the other hand, changes in the conditions
  greater in degree, or of a different nature, and crosses between forms
  which have been slowly and greatly modified by natural means,&mdash;in
  other words, between species,&mdash;are highly injurious, as far as the
  reproductive system is concerned, and in some few instances as far as
  constitutional vigour is concerned. Can this parallelism be accidental?
  Does it not rather indicate some real bond of connection? As a fire goes
  out unless it be stirred up, so the vital forces are always tending,
  according to Mr. Herbert Spencer, to a state of equilibrium, unless
  disturbed and renovated through the action of other forces.</p>

  <p>In some few cases varieties tend to keep distinct, by breeding at
  different periods, by great differences in size, or by sexual
  preference,&mdash;in this latter respect more especially resembling
  species in a state of nature. But the actual crossing of varieties, far
  from diminishing, generally adds to the fertility of both the first union
  and the mongrel offspring. Whether all <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>the most widely
  distinct domestic varieties are invariably quite fertile when crossed, we
  do not positively know; much time and trouble would be requisite for the
  necessary experiments, and many difficulties occur, such as the descent
  of the various races from aboriginally distinct species, and the doubts
  whether certain forms ought to be ranked as species or varieties.
  Nevertheless, the wide experience of practical breeders proves that the
  great majority of varieties, even if some should hereafter prove not to
  be indefinitely fertile <i>inter se</i>, are far more fertile when
  crossed, than the vast majority of closely allied natural species. A few
  remarkable cases have, however, been given on the authority of excellent
  observers, showing that with plants certain forms, which undoubtedly must
  be ranked as varieties, yield fewer seeds when crossed than is natural to
  the parent-species. Other varieties have had their reproductive powers so
  far modified that they are either more or less fertile than are their
  parents, when crossed with a distinct species.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the fact remains indisputable that domesticated
  varieties of animals and of plants, which differ greatly from each other
  in structure, but which are certainly descended from the same aboriginal
  species, such as the races of the fowl, pigeon, many vegetables, and a
  host of other productions, are extremely fertile when crossed; and this
  seems to make a broad and impassable barrier between domestic varieties
  and natural species. But, as I will now attempt to show, the distinction
  is not so great and overwhelmingly important as it at first appears.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>On the Difference in Fertility between Varieties and Species when
crossed.</i></p>

  <p>This work is not the proper place for fully treating the subject of
  hybridism, and I have already given in my 'Origin of Species' a
  moderately full abstract. I will here merely enumerate the general
  conclusions which may be relied on, and which bear on our present
  point.</p>

  <p><i>Firstly</i>, the laws governing the production of hybrids are
  identical, or nearly identical, in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.</p>

  <p><i>Secondly</i>, the sterility of distinct species when first united,
  <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page179"></a>{179}</span>and that of their hybrid offspring,
  graduates, by an almost infinite number of steps, from zero, when the
  ovule is never impregnated and a seed-capsule is never formed, up to
  complete fertility. We can only escape the conclusion that some species
  are fully fertile when crossed, by determining to designate as varieties
  all the forms which are quite fertile. This high degree of fertility is,
  however, rare. Nevertheless plants, which have been exposed to unnatural
  conditions, sometimes become modified in so peculiar a manner, that they
  are much more fertile when crossed by a distinct species than when
  fertilised by their own pollen. Success in effecting a first union
  between two species, and the fertility of their hybrids, depends in an
  eminent degree on the conditions of life being favourable. The innate
  sterility of hybrids of the same parentage and raised from the same
  seed-capsule often differs much in degree.</p>

  <p><i>Thirdly</i>, the degree of sterility of a first cross between two
  species does not always run strictly parallel with that of their hybrid
  offspring. Many cases are known of species which can be crossed with
  ease, but yield hybrids excessively sterile; and conversely some which
  can be crossed with great difficulty, but produce fairly fertile hybrids.
  This is an inexplicable fact, on the view that species have been
  specially endowed with mutual sterility in order to keep them
  distinct.</p>

  <p><i>Fourthly</i>, the degree of sterility often differs greatly in two
  species when reciprocally crossed; for the first will readily fertilise
  the second; but the latter is incapable, after hundreds of trials, of
  fertilising the former. Hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses between
  the same two species, likewise sometimes differ in their degree of
  sterility. These cases also are utterly inexplicable on the view of
  sterility being a special endowment.</p>

  <p><i>Fifthly</i>, the degree of sterility of first crosses and of
  hybrids runs, to a certain extent, parallel with the general or
  systematic affinity of the forms which are united. For species belonging
  to distinct genera can rarely, and those belonging to distinct families
  can never, be crossed. The parallelism, however, is far from complete;
  for a multitude of closely allied species will not unite, or unite with
  extreme difficulty, whilst other species, widely different from each
  other, can be crossed with perfect facility. Nor does the difficulty
  depend on ordinary <!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page180"></a>{180}</span>constitutional differences, for annual and
  perennial plants, deciduous and evergreen trees, plants flowering at
  different seasons, inhabiting different stations, and naturally living
  under the most opposite climates, can often be crossed with ease. The
  difficulty or facility apparently depends exclusively on the sexual
  constitution of the species which are crossed; or on their sexual
  elective affinity, <i>i. e.</i> <i>Wahlverwandtschaft</i> of Gärtner. As
  species rarely or never become modified in one character, without being
  at the same time modified in many, and as systematic affinity includes
  all visible resemblances and dissimilarities, any difference in sexual
  constitution between two species would naturally stand in more or less
  close relation with their systematic position.</p>

  <p><i>Sixthly</i>, the sterility of species when first crossed, and that
  of hybrids, may possibly depend to a certain extent on distinct causes.
  With pure species the reproductive organs are in a perfect condition,
  whilst with hybrids they are often plainly deteriorated. A hybrid embryo
  which partakes of the constitution of its father and mother is exposed to
  unnatural conditions, as long as it is nourished within the womb, or egg,
  or seed of the mother-form; and as we know that unnatural conditions
  often induce sterility, the reproductive organs of the hybrid might at
  this early age be permanently affected. But this cause has no bearing on
  the infertility of first unions. The diminished number of the offspring
  from first unions may often result, as is certainly sometimes the case,
  from the premature death of most of the hybrid embryos. But we shall
  immediately see that a law of an unknown nature apparently exists, which
  causes the offspring from unions, which are infertile, to be themselves
  more or less infertile; and this at present is all that can be said.</p>

  <p><i>Seventhly</i>, hybrids and mongrels present, with the one great
  exception of fertility, the most striking accordance in all other
  respects; namely, in the laws of their resemblance to their two parents,
  in their tendency to reversion, in their variability, and in being
  absorbed through repeated crosses by either parent-form.</p>

  <p>Since arriving at the foregoing conclusions, condensed from my former
  work, I have been led to investigate a subject which throws considerable
  light on hybridism, namely, the fertility of <!-- Page 181 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>reciprocally dimorphic
  and trimorphic plants, when illegitimately united. I have had occasion
  several times to allude to these plants, and I may here give a brief
  abstract<a name="NtA_441" href="#Nt_441"><sup>[441]</sup></a> of my
  observations. Several plants belonging to distinct orders present two
  forms, which exist in about equal numbers, and which differ in no respect
  except in their reproductive organs; one form having a long pistil with
  short stamens, the other a short pistil with long stamens; both with
  differently sized pollen-grains. With trimorphic plants there are three
  forms likewise differing in the lengths of their pistils and stamens, in
  the size and colour of the pollen-grains, and in some other respects; and
  as in each of the three forms there are two sets of stamens, there are
  altogether six sets of stamens and three kinds of pistils. These organs
  are so proportioned in length to each other that, in any two of the
  forms, half the stamens in each stand on a level with the stigma of the
  third form. Now I have shown, and the result has been confirmed by other
  observers, that, in order to obtain full fertility with these plants, it
  is necessary that the stigma of the one form should be fertilised by
  pollen taken from the stamens of corresponding height in the other form.
  So that with dimorphic species two unions, which may be called
  legitimate, are fully fertile, and two, which may be called illegitimate,
  are more or less infertile. With trimorphic species six unions are
  legitimate or fully fertile, and twelve are illegitimate or more or less
  infertile.</p>

  <p>The infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and
  trimorphic plants, when they are illegitimately fertilised, that is, by
  pollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil,
  differs much in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility; just in the
  same manner as occurs in crossing distinct species. As the degree of
  sterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on the
  conditions of life being more or less favourable, so I have found it with
  illegitimate unions. It is well known that if pollen of a distinct
  species be placed on the stigma of a flower, and its own pollen be
  afterwards, even <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>{182}</span>after a considerable interval of time,
  placed on the same stigma, its action is so strongly prepotent that it
  generally annihilates the effect of the foreign pollen; so it is with the
  pollen of the several forms of the same species, for legitimate pollen is
  strongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when both are placed on the
  same stigma. I ascertained this by fertilising several flowers, first
  illegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately, with
  pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the seedlings
  were similarly coloured; this shows that the legitimate pollen, though
  applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly destroyed or prevented
  the action of the previously applied illegitimate pollen. Again, as, in
  making reciprocal crosses between the same two species, there is
  occasionally a great difference in the result, so something analogous
  occurs with dimorphic plants; for a short-styled cowslip (<i>P.
  veris</i>) yields more seed when fertilised by the long-styled form, and
  less seed when fertilised by its own form, compared with a long-styled
  cowslip when fertilised in the two corresponding methods.</p>

  <p>In all these respects the forms of the same undoubted species, when
  illegitimately united, behave in exactly the same manner as do two
  distinct species when crossed. This led me carefully to observe during
  four years many seedlings, raised from several illegitimate unions. The
  chief result is that these illegitimate plants, as they may be called,
  are not fully fertile. It is possible to raise from dimorphic species,
  both long-styled and short-styled illegitimate plants, and from
  trimorphic plants all three illegitimate forms. These can then be
  properly united in a legitimate manner. When this is done, there is no
  apparent reason why they should not yield as many seeds as did their
  parents when legitimately fertilised. But such is not the case; they are
  all infertile, but in various degrees; some being so utterly and
  incurably sterile that they did not yield during four seasons a single
  seed or even seed-capsule. These illegitimate plants, which are so
  sterile, although united with each other in a legitimate manner, may be
  strictly compared with hybrids when crossed <i>inter se</i>, and it is
  well known how sterile these latter generally are. When, on the other
  hand, a hybrid is crossed with either pure parent-species, the sterility
  is usually much lessened: and so it is when an illegitimate plant is
  fertilised by <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>{183}</span>a legitimate plant. In the same manner as
  the sterility of hybrids does not always run parallel with the difficulty
  of making the first cross between the two parent species, so the
  sterility of certain illegitimate plants was unusually great, whilst the
  sterility of the union from which they were derived was by no means
  great. With hybrids raised from the same seed-capsule the degree of
  sterility is innately variable, so it is in a marked manner with
  illegitimate plants. Lastly, many hybrids are profuse and persistent
  flowerers, whilst other and more sterile hybrids produce few flowers, and
  are weak, miserable dwarfs; exactly similar cases occur with the
  illegitimate offspring of various dimorphic and trimorphic plants.</p>

  <p>Altogether there is the closest identity in character and behaviour
  between illegitimate plants and hybrids. It is hardly an exaggeration to
  maintain that the former are hybrids, but produced within the limits of
  the same species by the improper union of certain forms, whilst ordinary
  hybrids are produced from an improper union between so-called distinct
  species. We have already seen that there is the closest similarity in all
  respects between first illegitimate unions, and first crosses between
  distinct species. This will perhaps be made more fully apparent by an
  illustration: we may suppose that a botanist found two well-marked
  varieties (and such occur) of the long-styled form of the trimorphic
  <i>Lythrum salicaria</i>, and that he determined to try by crossing
  whether they were specifically distinct. He would find that they yielded
  only about one-fifth of the proper number of seed, and that they behaved
  in all the other above-specified respects as if they had been two
  distinct species. But to make the case sure, he would raise plants from
  his supposed hybridised seed, and he would find that the seedlings were
  miserably dwarfed and utterly sterile, and that they behaved in all other
  respects like ordinary hybrids. He might then maintain that he had
  actually proved, in accordance with the common view, that his two
  varieties were as good and as distinct species as any in the world; but
  he would be completely mistaken.</p>

  <p>The facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are important,
  because they show us, firstly, that the physiological <!-- Page 184
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>{184}</span>test of
  lessened fertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe
  criterion of specific distinction; secondly, because we may conclude that
  there must be some unknown law or bond connecting the infertility of
  illegitimate unions with that of their illegitimate offspring, and we are
  thus led to extend this view to first crosses and hybrids; thirdly,
  because we find, and this seems to me of especial importance, that with
  trimorphic plants three forms of the same species exist, which when
  crossed in a particular manner are infertile, and yet these forms differ
  in no respect from each other, except in their reproductive
  organs,&mdash;as in the relative length of the stamens and pistils, in
  the size, form, and colour of the pollen-grains, in the structure of the
  stigma, and in, the number and size of the seeds. With these differences
  and no others, either in organisation or constitution, we find that the
  illegitimate unions and the illegitimate progeny of these three forms are
  more or less sterile, and closely resemble in a whole series of relations
  the first unions and hybrid offspring of distinct species. From this we
  may infer that the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid
  progeny is likewise in all probability exclusively due to differences
  confined to the reproductive system. We have indeed been brought to a
  similar conclusion by observing that the sterility of crossed species
  does not strictly coincide with their systematic affinity, that is, with
  the sum of their external resemblances; nor does it coincide with their
  similarity in general constitution. But we are more especially led to
  this same conclusion by considering reciprocal crosses, in which the male
  of one species cannot be united, or can be united with extreme
  difficulty, with the female of a second species, whilst the converse
  cross can be effected with perfect facility; for this difference in the
  facility of making reciprocal crosses, and in the fertility of their
  offspring, must be attributed either to the male or female element in the
  first species having been differentiated with reference to the sexual
  element of the second species in a higher degree than in the converse
  case. In so complex a subject as Hybridism it is of considerable
  importance thus to arrive at a definitive conclusion, namely, that the
  sterility which almost invariably follows the union of distinct <!-- Page
  185 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>species
  depends exclusively on differences in their sexual constitution.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>On the principle which makes it necessary for man, whilst he is
  selecting and improving his domestic varieties, to keep them separate, it
  would clearly be advantageous to varieties in a state of nature, that is
  to incipient species, if they could be kept from blending, either through
  sexual aversion, or by becoming mutually sterile. Hence it at one time
  appeared to me probable, as it has to others, that this sterility might
  have been acquired through natural selection. On this view we must
  suppose that a shade of lessened fertility first spontaneously appeared,
  like any other modification, in certain individuals of a species when
  crossed with other individuals of the same species; and that successive
  slight degrees of infertility, from being advantageous, were slowly
  accumulated. This appears all the more probable, if we admit that the
  structural differences between the forms of dimorphic and trimorphic
  plants, as the length and curvature of the pistil, &amp;c., have been
  co-adapted through natural selection; for if this be admitted, we can
  hardly avoid extending the same conclusion to their mutual infertility.
  Sterility moreover has been acquired through natural selection for other
  and widely different purposes, as with neuter insects in reference to
  their social economy. In the case of plants, the flowers on the
  circumference of the truss in the guelder-rose (<i>Viburnum opulus</i>)
  and those on the summit of the spike in the feather-hyacinth (<i>Muscari
  comosum</i>) have been rendered conspicuous, and apparently in
  consequence sterile, in order that insects might easily discover and
  visit the other flowers. But when we endeavour to apply the principle of
  natural selection to the acquirement by distinct species of mutual
  sterility, we meet with great difficulties. In the first place, it may be
  remarked that separate regions are often inhabited by groups of species
  or by single species, which when brought together and crossed are found
  to be more or less sterile; now it could clearly have been of no
  advantage to such separated species to have been rendered mutually
  sterile, and consequently this could not have been effected through
  natural selection; but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a species were
  rendered sterile with <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page186"></a>{186}</span>some one compatriot, sterility with other
  species would follow as a necessary consequence. In the second place, it
  is as much opposed to the theory of natural selection, as to the theory
  of special creation, that in reciprocal crosses the male element of one
  form should have been rendered utterly impotent on a second form, whilst
  at the same time the male element of this second form is enabled freely
  to fertilise the first form; for this peculiar state of the reproductive
  system could not possibly be advantageous to either species.</p>

  <p>In considering the probability of natural selection having come into
  action in rendering species mutually sterile, one great difficulty will
  be found to lie in the existence of many graduated steps from slightly
  lessened fertility to absolute sterility. It may be admitted, on the
  principle above explained, that it would profit an incipient species if
  it were rendered in some slight degree sterile when crossed with its
  parent-form or with some other variety; for thus fewer bastardised and
  deteriorated offspring would be produced to commingle their blood with
  the new species in process of formation. But he who will take the trouble
  to reflect on the steps by which this first degree of sterility could be
  increased through natural selection to that higher degree which is common
  to so many species, and which is universal with species which have been
  differentiated to a generic or family rank, will find the subject
  extraordinarily complex. After mature reflection it seems to me that this
  could not have been effected through natural selection; for it could have
  been of no direct advantage to an individual animal to breed badly with
  another individual of a different variety, and thus leave few offspring;
  consequently such individuals could not have been preserved or selected.
  Or take the case of two species which in their present state, when
  crossed, produce few and sterile offspring; now, what is there which
  could favour the survival of those individuals which happened to be
  endowed in a slightly higher degree with mutual infertility and which
  thus approached by one small step towards absolute sterility? yet an
  advance of this kind, if the theory of natural selection be brought to
  bear, must have incessantly occurred with many species, for a multitude
  are mutually quite barren. With sterile neuter insects we have reason to
  <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page187"></a>{187}</span>believe that modifications in their
  structure have been slowly accumulated by natural selection, from an
  advantage having been thus indirectly given to the community to which
  they belonged over other communities of the same species; but an
  individual animal, if rendered slightly sterile when crossed with some
  other variety, would not thus in itself gain any advantage, or indirectly
  give any advantage to its nearest relatives or to other individuals of
  the same variety, leading to their preservation. I infer from these
  considerations that, as far as animals are concerned, the various degrees
  of lessened fertility which occur with species when crossed cannot have
  been slowly accumulated by means of natural selection.</p>

  <p>With plants, it is possible that the case may be somewhat different.
  With many kinds, insects constantly carry pollen from neighbouring plants
  to the stigmas of each flower; and with some species this is effected by
  the wind. Now, if the pollen of a variety, when deposited on the stigma
  of the same variety, should become by spontaneous variation in ever so
  slight a degree prepotent over the pollen of other varieties, this would
  certainly be an advantage to the variety; for its own pollen would thus
  obliterate the effects of the pollen of other varieties, and prevent
  deterioration of character. And the more prepotent the variety's own
  pollen could be rendered through natural selection, the greater the
  advantage would be. We know from the researches of Gärtner that, with
  species which are mutually sterile, the pollen of each is always
  prepotent on its own stigma over that of the other species; but we do not
  know whether this prepotency is a consequence of the mutual sterility, or
  the sterility a consequence of the prepotency. If the latter view be
  correct, as the prepotency became stronger through natural selection,
  from being advantageous to a species in process of formation, so the
  sterility consequent on prepotency would at the same time be augmented;
  and the final result would be various degrees of sterility, such as
  occurs with existing species. This view might be extended to animals, if
  the female before each birth received several males, so that the sexual
  element of the prepotent male of her own variety obliterated the effects
  of the access of previous males belonging to other varieties; but we have
  no reason to believe, at least <!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page188"></a>{188}</span>with terrestrial animals, that this is the
  ease; as most males and females pair for each birth, and some few for
  life.</p>

  <p>On the whole we may conclude that with animals the sterility of
  crossed species has not been slowly augmented through natural selection;
  and as this sterility follows the same general laws in the vegetable as
  in the animal kingdom, it is improbable, though apparently possible, that
  with plants crossed species should have been rendered sterile by a
  different process. From this consideration, and remembering that species
  which have never co-existed in the same country, and which therefore
  could not have received any advantage from having been rendered mutually
  infertile, yet are generally sterile when crossed; and bearing in mind
  that in reciprocal crosses between the same two species there is
  sometimes the widest difference in their sterility, we must give up the
  belief that natural selection has come into play.</p>

  <p>As species have not been rendered mutually infertile through the
  accumulative action of natural selection, and as we may safely conclude,
  from the previous as well as from other and more general considerations,
  that they have not been endowed through an act of creation with this
  quality, we must infer that it has arisen incidentally during their slow
  formation in connection with other and unknown changes in their
  organisation. By a quality arising incidentally, I refer to such cases as
  different species of animals and plants being differently affected by
  poisons to which they are not naturally exposed; and this difference in
  susceptibility is clearly incidental on other and unknown differences in
  their organisation. So again the capacity in different kinds of trees to
  be grafted on each other, or on a third species, differs much, and is of
  no advantage to these trees, but is incidental on structural or
  functional differences in their woody tissues. We need not feel surprise
  at sterility incidentally resulting from crosses between distinct
  species,&mdash;the modified descendants of a common
  progenitor,&mdash;when we bear in mind how easily the reproductive system
  is affected by various causes&mdash;often by extremely slight changes in
  the conditions of life, by too close interbreeding, and by other
  agencies. It is well to bear in mind such cases, as that of the
  <i>Passiflora alata</i>, which recovered its self-fertility from <!--
  Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"></a>{189}</span>being
  grafted on a distinct species&mdash;the cases of plants which normally or
  abnormally are self-impotent, but can readily be fertilised by the pollen
  of a distinct species&mdash;and lastly the cases of individual
  domesticated animals which evince towards each other sexual
  incompatibility.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We now at last come to the immediate point under discussion: how is it
  that, with some few exceptions in the case of plants, domesticated
  varieties, such as those of the dog, fowl, pigeon, several fruit-trees,
  and culinary vegetables, which differ from each other in external
  characters more than many species, are perfectly fertile when crossed, or
  even fertile in excess, whilst closely allied species are almost
  invariably in some degree sterile? We can, to a certain extent, give a
  satisfactory answer to this question. Passing over the fact that the
  amount of external difference between two species is no sure guide to
  their degree of mutual sterility, so that similar differences in the case
  of varieties would be no sure guide, we know that with species the cause
  lies exclusively in differences in their sexual constitution. Now the
  conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated plants have been
  subjected, have had so little tendency towards modifying the reproductive
  system in a manner leading to mutual sterility, that we have good grounds
  for admitting the directly opposite doctrine of Pallas, namely, that such
  conditions generally eliminate this tendency; so that the domesticated
  descendants of species, which in their natural state would have been in
  some degree sterile when crossed, become perfectly fertile together. With
  plants, so far is cultivation from giving a tendency towards mutual
  sterility, that in several well-authenticated cases, already often
  alluded to, certain species have been affected in a very different
  manner, for they have become self-impotent, whilst still retaining the
  capacity of fertilising, and being fertilised by, distinct species. If
  the Pallasian doctrine of the elimination of sterility through
  long-continued domestication be admitted, and it can hardly be rejected,
  it becomes in the highest degree improbable that similar circumstances
  should commonly both induce and eliminate the same tendency; though in
  certain cases, with species having a peculiar constitution, sterility
  might occasionally be thus <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>{190}</span>induced. Thus, as I believe, we can
  understand why with domesticated animals varieties have not been produced
  which are mutually sterile; and why with plants only a few such cases
  have been observed, namely, by Gärtner, with certain varieties of maize
  and verbascum, by other experimentalists with varieties of the gourd and
  melon, and by Kölreuter with one kind of tobacco.</p>

  <p>With respect to varieties which have originated in a state of nature,
  it is almost hopeless to expect to prove by direct evidence that they
  have been rendered mutually sterile; for if even a trace of sterility
  could be detected, such varieties would at once be raised by almost every
  naturalist to the rank of distinct species. If, for instance, Gärtner's
  statement were fully confirmed, that the blue and red-flowered forms of
  the pimpernel (<i>Anagallis arvensis</i>) are sterile when crossed, I
  presume that all the botanists who now maintain on various grounds that
  these two forms are merely fleeting varieties, would at once admit that
  they were specifically distinct.</p>

  <p>The real difficulty in our present subject is not, as it appears to
  me, why domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when
  crossed, but why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties as
  soon as they have been modified in a sufficient and permanent degree to
  take rank as species. We are far from precisely knowing the cause; nor is
  this surprising, seeing how profoundly ignorant we are in regard to the
  normal and abnormal action of the reproductive system. But we can see
  that species, owing to their struggle for life with numerous competitors,
  must have been exposed to more uniform conditions during long periods of
  time, than have been domestic varieties; and this may well make a wide
  difference in the result. For we know how commonly wild animals and
  plants, when taken from their natural conditions and subjected to
  captivity, are rendered sterile; and the reproductive functions of
  organic beings which have always lived and been slowly modified under
  natural conditions would probably in like manner be eminently sensitive
  to the influence of an unnatural cross. Domesticated productions, on the
  other hand, which, as shown by the mere fact of their domestication, were
  not originally highly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life,
  and which can now generally resist <!-- Page 191 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>{191}</span>with undiminished
  fertility repeated changes of conditions, might be expected to produce
  varieties, which would be little liable to have their reproductive powers
  injuriously affected by the act of crossing with other varieties which
  had originated in a like manner.</p>

  <p>Certain naturalists have recently laid too great stress, as it appears
  to me, on the difference in fertility between varieties and species when
  crossed. Some allied species of trees cannot be grafted on each
  other,&mdash;all varieties can be so grafted. Some allied animals are
  affected in a very different manner by the same poison, but with
  varieties no such case until recently was known, but now it has been
  proved that immunity from certain poisons stands in some cases in
  correlation with the colour of the hair. The period of gestation
  generally differs much with distinct species, but with varieties until
  lately no such difference had been observed. The time required for the
  germination of seeds differs in an analogous manner, and I am not aware
  that any difference in this respect has as yet been detected with
  varieties. Here we have various physiological differences, and no doubt
  others could be added, between one species and another of the same genus,
  which do not occur, or occur with extreme rarity, in the case of
  varieties; and these differences are apparently wholly or in chief part
  incidental on other constitutional differences, just in the same manner
  as the sterility of crossed species is incidental on differences confined
  to the sexual system. Why, then, should these latter differences, however
  serviceable they may indirectly be in keeping the inhabitants of the same
  country distinct, be thought of such paramount importance, in comparison
  with other incidental and functional differences? No sufficient answer to
  this question can be given. Hence the fact that the most distinct
  domestic varieties are, with rare exceptions, perfectly fertile when
  crossed, and produce fertile offspring, whilst closely allied species
  are, with rare exceptions, more or less sterile, is not nearly so
  formidable an objection as it appears at first to the theory of the
  common descent of allied species.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The power of Selection, whether exercised by man, or brought into play
  under nature through the struggle for existence and the consequent
  survival of the fittest, absolutely depends on the variability of organic
  beings. Without variability nothing can be effected; slight individual
  differences, however, suffice for the work, and are probably the sole
  differences which are effective in the production of new species. Hence
  our discussion on the causes and laws of variability ought in strict
  order to have preceded our present subject, as well as the previous
  subjects of inheritance, crossing, &amp;c.; but practically the present
  arrangement has been found the most convenient. Man does not attempt to
  cause variability; though he unintentionally effects this by exposing
  organisms to new conditions of life, and by crossing breeds already
  formed. But variability being granted, he works wonders. Unless some
  degree of selection be exercised, the free commingling of the individuals
  of the same variety soon obliterates, as we have previously seen, the
  slight differences which may arise, and gives to the whole body of
  individuals uniformity of character. In separated districts,
  long-continued exposure to different conditions of life may perhaps
  produce new races without the aid of selection; but to this difficult
  subject <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page193"></a>{193}</span>of the direct action of the conditions of
  life we shall in a future chapter recur.</p>

  <p>When animals or plants are born with some conspicuous and firmly
  inherited new character, selection is reduced to the preservation of such
  individuals, and to the subsequent prevention of crosses; so that nothing
  more need be said on the subject. But in the great majority of cases a
  new character, or some superiority in an old character, is at first
  faintly pronounced, and is not strongly inherited; and then the full
  difficulty of selection is experienced. Indomitable patience, the finest
  powers of discrimination, and sound judgment must be exercised during
  many years. A clearly predetermined object must be kept steadily in view.
  Few men are endowed with all these qualities, especially with that of
  discriminating very slight differences; judgment can be acquired only by
  long experience; but if any of these qualities be wanting, the labour of
  a life may be thrown away. I have been astonished when celebrated
  breeders, whose skill and judgment have been proved by their success at
  exhibitions, have shown me their animals, which appeared all alike, and
  have assigned their reasons for matching this and that individual. The
  importance of the great principle of Selection mainly lies in this power
  of selecting scarcely appreciable differences, which nevertheless are
  found to be transmissible, and which can be accumulated until the result
  is made manifest to the eyes of every beholder.</p>

  <p>The principle of selection may be conveniently divided into three
  kinds. <i>Methodical selection</i> is that which guides a man who
  systematically endeavours to modify a breed according to some
  predetermined standard. <i>Unconscious selection</i> is that which
  follows from men naturally preserving the most valued and destroying the
  less valued individuals, without any thought of altering the breed; and
  undoubtedly this process slowly works great changes. Unconscious
  selection graduates into methodical, and only extreme cases can be
  distinctly separated; for he who preserves a useful or perfect animal
  will generally breed from it with the hope of getting offspring of the
  same character; but as long as he has not a predetermined purpose to
  improve the breed, he may be said to be selecting <!-- Page 194 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>{194}</span>unconsciously.<a
  name="NtA_442" href="#Nt_442"><sup>[442]</sup></a> Lastly, we have
  <i>Natural selection</i>, which implies that the individuals which are
  best fitted for the complex, and in the course of ages changing
  conditions to which they are exposed, generally survive and procreate
  their kind. With domestic productions, with which alone we are here
  strictly concerned, natural selection comes to a certain extent into
  action, independently of, and even in opposition to, the will of man.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Methodical Selection.</i>&mdash;What man has effected within recent
  times in England by methodical selection is clearly shown by our
  exhibitions of improved quadrupeds and fancy birds. With respect to
  cattle, sheep, and pigs, we owe their great improvement to a long series
  of well-known names&mdash;Bakewell, Colling, Ellman, Bates, Jonas Webb,
  Lords Leicester and Western, Fisher Hobbs, and others. Agricultural
  writers are unanimous on the power of selection: any number of statements
  to this effect could be quoted; a few will suffice. Youatt, a sagacious
  and experienced observer, writes,<a name="NtA_443"
  href="#Nt_443"><sup>[443]</sup></a> the principle of selection is "that
  which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his
  flock, but to change it altogether." A great breeder of shorthorns<a
  name="NtA_444" href="#Nt_444"><sup>[444]</sup></a> says, "In the anatomy
  of the shoulder modern breeders have made great improvements on the
  Ketton shorthorns by correcting the defect in the knuckle or
  shoulder-joint, and by laying the top of the shoulder more snugly into
  the crop, and thereby filling up the hollow behind it.... The eye has its
  fashion at different periods: at one time the eye high and outstanding
  from the head, and at another time the sleepy eye sunk into the head; but
  these extremes have merged into the medium of a full, clear, and
  prominent eye with a placid look."</p>

  <p>Again, hear what an excellent judge of pigs<a name="NtA_445"
  href="#Nt_445"><sup>[445]</sup></a> says: "The legs <!-- Page 195
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>{195}</span>should be no
  longer than just to prevent the animal's belly from trailing on the
  ground. The leg is the least profitable portion of the hog, and we
  therefore require no more of it than is absolutely necessary for the
  support of the rest." Let any one compare the wild-boar with any improved
  breed, and he will see how effectually the legs have been shortened.</p>

  <p>Few persons, except breeders, are aware of the systematic care taken
  in selecting animals, and of the necessity of having a clear and almost
  prophetic vision into futurity. Lord Spencer's skill and judgment were
  well known; and he writes,<a name="NtA_446"
  href="#Nt_446"><sup>[446]</sup></a> "It is therefore very desirable,
  before any man commences to breed either cattle or sheep, that he should
  make up his mind to the shape and qualities he wishes to obtain, and
  steadily pursue this object." Lord Somerville, in speaking of the
  marvellous improvement of the New Leicester sheep, effected by Bakewell
  and his successors, says, "It would seem as if they had first drawn a
  perfect form, and then given it life." Youatt<a name="NtA_447"
  href="#Nt_447"><sup>[447]</sup></a> urges the necessity of annually
  drafting each flock, as many animals will certainly degenerate "from the
  standard of excellence, which the breeder has established in his own
  mind." Even with a bird of such little importance as the canary, long ago
  (1780-1790) rules were established, and a standard of perfection was
  fixed, according to which the London fanciers tried to breed the several
  sub-varieties.<a name="NtA_448" href="#Nt_448"><sup>[448]</sup></a> A
  great winner of prizes at the Pigeon-shows,<a name="NtA_449"
  href="#Nt_449"><sup>[449]</sup></a> in describing the Short-faced Almond
  Tumbler, says, "There are many first-rate fanciers who are particularly
  partial to what is called the goldfinch-beak, which is very beautiful;
  others say, take a full-size round cherry, then take a barley-corn, and
  judiciously placing and thrusting it into the cherry, form as it were
  your beak; and that is not all, for it will form a good head and beak,
  provided, as I said before, it is judiciously done; others take an oat;
  but as I think the goldfinch-beak the handsomest, I would advise the
  inexperienced fancier to get the head of a goldfinch, and keep it by him
  for his observation." Wonderfully different as is the beak of the
  rock-pigeon and goldfinch, undoubtedly, as far as <!-- Page 196 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>{196}</span>external shape and
  proportions are concerned, the end has been nearly gained.</p>

  <p>Not only should our animals be examined with the greatest care whilst
  alive, but, as Anderson remarks,<a name="NtA_450"
  href="#Nt_450"><sup>[450]</sup></a> their carcases should be scrutinised,
  "so as to breed from the descendants of such only as, in the language of
  the butcher, cut up well." The "grain of the meat" in cattle, and its
  being well marbled with fat,<a name="NtA_451"
  href="#Nt_451"><sup>[451]</sup></a> and the greater or less accumulation
  of fat in the abdomen of our sheep, have been attended to with success.
  So with poultry, a writer,<a name="NtA_452"
  href="#Nt_452"><sup>[452]</sup></a> speaking of Cochin-China fowls, which
  are said to differ much in the quality of their flesh, says, "the best
  mode is to purchase two young brother-cocks, kill, dress, and serve up
  one; if he be indifferent, similarly dispose of the other, and try again;
  if, however, he be fine and well-flavoured, his brother will not be amiss
  for breeding purposes for the table."</p>

  <p>The great principle of the division of labour has been brought to bear
  on selection. In certain districts<a name="NtA_453"
  href="#Nt_453"><sup>[453]</sup></a> "the breeding of bulls is confined to
  a very limited number of persons, who by devoting their whole attention
  to this department, are able from year to year to furnish a class of
  bulls which are steadily improving the general breed of the district."
  The rearing and letting of choice rams has long been, as is well known, a
  chief source of profit to several eminent breeders. In parts of Germany
  this principle is carried with merino sheep to an extreme point.<a
  name="NtA_454" href="#Nt_454"><sup>[454]</sup></a> "So important is the
  proper selection of breeding animals considered, that the best
  flock-masters do not trust to their own judgment, or to that of their
  shepherds, but employ persons called 'sheep-classifiers,' who make it
  their special business to attend to this part of the management of
  several flocks, and thus to preserve, or if possible to improve, the best
  qualities of both parents in the lambs." In Saxony, "when the lambs are
  weaned, each in his turn is placed upon a table that his wool and form
  may be minutely observed. <!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page197"></a>{197}</span>The finest are selected for breeding and
  receive a first mark. When they are one year old, and prior to shearing
  them, another close examination of those previously marked takes place:
  those in which no defect can be found receive a second mark, and the rest
  are condemned. A few months afterwards a third and last scrutiny is made;
  the prime rams and ewes receive a third and final mark, but the slightest
  blemish is sufficient to cause the rejection of the animal." These sheep
  are bred and valued almost exclusively for the fineness of their wool;
  and the result corresponds with the labour bestowed on their selection.
  Instruments have been invented to measure accurately the thickness of the
  fibres; and "an Austrian fleece has been produced of which twelve hairs
  equalled in thickness one from a Leicester sheep."</p>

  <p>Throughout the world, wherever silk is produced, the greatest care is
  bestowed on selecting the cocoons from which the moths for breeding are
  to be reared. A careful cultivator<a name="NtA_455"
  href="#Nt_455"><sup>[455]</sup></a> likewise examines the moths
  themselves, and destroys those that are not perfect. But what more
  immediately concerns us is that certain families in France devote
  themselves to raising eggs for sale.<a name="NtA_456"
  href="#Nt_456"><sup>[456]</sup></a> In China, near Shanghai, the
  inhabitants of two small districts have the privilege of raising eggs for
  the whole surrounding country, and that they may give up their whole time
  to this business, they are interdicted by law from producing silk.<a
  name="NtA_457" href="#Nt_457"><sup>[457]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The care which successful breeders take in matching their birds is
  surprising. Sir John Sebright, whose fame is perpetuated by the "Sebright
  Bantam," used to spend "two and three days in examining, consulting, and
  disputing with a friend which were the best of five or six birds."<a
  name="NtA_458" href="#Nt_458"><sup>[458]</sup></a> Mr. Bult, whose
  pouter-pigeons won so many prizes and were exported to North America
  under the charge of a man sent on purpose, told me that he always
  deliberated for several days before he matched each pair. Hence we can
  understand the advice of an eminent fancier, who writes,<a name="NtA_459"
  href="#Nt_459"><sup>[459]</sup></a> "I would here particularly guard <!--
  Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>{198}</span>you
  against having too great a variety of pigeons, otherwise you will know a
  little of all, but nothing about one as it ought to be known." Apparently
  it transcends the power of the human intellect to breed all kinds: "it is
  possible that there may be a few fanciers that have a good general
  knowledge of fancy pigeons; but there are many more who labour under the
  delusion of supposing they know what they do not." The excellence of one
  sub-variety, the Almond Tumbler, lies in the plumage, carriage, head,
  beak, and eye; but it is too presumptuous in the beginner to try for all
  these points. The great judge above quoted says, "there are some young
  fanciers who are over-covetous, who go for all the above five properties
  at once; they have their reward by getting nothing." We thus see that
  breeding even fancy pigeons is no simple art: we may smile at the
  solemnity of these precepts, but he who laughs will win no prizes.</p>

  <p>What methodical selection has effected for our animals is sufficiently
  proved, as already remarked, by our Exhibitions. So greatly were the
  sheep belonging to some of the earlier breeders, such as Bakewell and
  Lord Western, changed, that many persons could not be persuaded that they
  had not been crossed. Our pigs, as Mr. Corringham remarks,<a
  name="NtA_460" href="#Nt_460"><sup>[460]</sup></a> during the last twenty
  years have undergone, through rigorous selection together with crossing,
  a complete metamorphosis. The first exhibition for poultry was held in
  the Zoological Gardens in 1845; and the improvement effected since that
  time has been great. As Mr. Baily, the great judge, remarked to me, it
  was formerly ordered that the comb of the Spanish cock should be upright,
  and in four or five years all good birds had upright combs; it was
  ordered that the Polish cock should have no comb or wattles, and now a
  bird thus furnished would be at once disqualified; beards were ordered,
  and out of fifty-seven pens lately (1860) exhibited at the Crystal
  Palace, all had beards. So it has been in many other cases. But in all
  cases the judges order only what is occasionally produced and what can be
  improved and rendered constant by selection. The steady increase of
  weight during the last few years in our <!-- Page 199 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>{199}</span>fowls, turkeys, ducks,
  and geese is notorious; "six-pound ducks are now common, whereas four
  pounds was formerly the average." As the actual time required to make a
  change has not often been recorded, it may be worth mentioning that it
  took Mr. Wicking thirteen years to put a clean white head on an almond
  tumbler's body, "a triumph," says another fancier, "of which he may be
  justly proud."<a name="NtA_461" href="#Nt_461"><sup>[461]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Mr. Tollet, of Betley Hall, selected cows, and especially bulls,
  descended from good milkers, for the sole purpose of improving his cattle
  for the production of cheese; he steadily tested the milk with the
  lactometer, and in eight years he increased, as I was informed by him,
  the product in the proportion of four to three. Here is a curious case<a
  name="NtA_462" href="#Nt_462"><sup>[462]</sup></a> of steady but slow
  progress, with the end not as yet fully attained: in 1784 a race of
  silkworms was introduced into France, in which one hundred out of the
  thousand failed to produce white cocoons; but now, after careful
  selection during sixty-five generations, the proportion of yellow cocoons
  has been reduced to thirty-five in the thousand.</p>

  <p>With plants selection has been followed with the same good results as
  with animals. But the process is simpler, for plants in the great
  majority of cases bear both sexes. Nevertheless, with most kinds it is
  necessary to take as much care to prevent crosses as with animals or
  unisexual plants; but with some plants, such as peas, this care does not
  seem to be necessary. With all improved plants, excepting of course those
  which are propagated by buds, cuttings, &amp;c., it is almost
  indispensable to examine the seedlings and destroy those which depart
  from the proper type. This is called "roguing," and is, in fact, a form
  of selection, like the rejection of inferior animals. Experienced
  horticulturists and agriculturists incessantly urge every one to preserve
  the finest plants for the production of seed.</p>

  <p>Although plants often present much more conspicuous variations than
  animals, yet the closest attention is generally requisite to detect each
  slight and favourable change. Mr. Masters relates<a name="NtA_463"
  href="#Nt_463"><sup>[463]</sup></a> how "many a patient hour was
  devoted," whilst he was <!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page200"></a>{200}</span>young, to the detection of differences in
  peas intended for seed. Mr. Barnet<a name="NtA_464"
  href="#Nt_464"><sup>[464]</sup></a> remarks that the old scarlet American
  strawberry was cultivated for more than a century without producing a
  single variety; and another writer observes how singular it was that when
  gardeners first began to attend to this fruit it began to vary; the truth
  no doubt being that it had always varied, but that, until slight
  varieties were selected and propagated by seed, no conspicuous result was
  obtained. The finest shades of difference in wheat have been
  discriminated and selected with almost as much care, as we see in Colonel
  Le Couteur's works, as in the case of the higher animals; but with our
  cereals the process of selection has seldom or never been long
  continued.</p>

  <p>It may be worth while to give a few examples of methodical selection
  with plants; but in fact the great improvement of all our anciently
  cultivated plants may be attributed to selection long carried on, in part
  methodically, and in part unconsciously. I have shown in a former chapter
  how the weight of the gooseberry has been increased by systematic
  selection and culture. The flowers of the Heartsease have been similarly
  increased in size and regularity of outline. With the Cineraria, Mr.
  Glenny<a name="NtA_465" href="#Nt_465"><sup>[465]</sup></a> "was bold
  enough, when the flowers were ragged and starry and ill defined in
  colour, to fix a standard which was then considered outrageously high and
  impossible, and which, even if reached, it was said, we should be no
  gainers by, as it would spoil the beauty of the flowers. He maintained
  that he was right; and the event has proved it to be so." The doubling of
  flowers has several times been effected by careful selection: the Rev. W.
  Williamson,<a name="NtA_466" href="#Nt_466"><sup>[466]</sup></a> after
  sowing during several years seed of <i>Anemone coronaria</i>, found a
  plant with one additional petal; he sowed the seed of this, and by
  perseverance in the same course obtained several varieties with six or
  seven rows of petals. The single Scotch rose was doubled, and yielded
  eight good varieties in nine or ten years.<a name="NtA_467"
  href="#Nt_467"><sup>[467]</sup></a> The Canterbury bell (<i>Campanula
  medium</i>) was doubled by careful selection in four generations.<a
  name="NtA_468" href="#Nt_468"><sup>[468]</sup></a> In four years Mr.
  Buckman,<a name="NtA_469" href="#Nt_469"><sup>[469]</sup></a> by culture
  and <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page201"></a>{201}</span>careful selection, converted parsnips,
  raised from wild seed, into a new and good variety. By selection during a
  long course of years, the early maturity of peas has been hastened from
  ten to twenty-one days.<a name="NtA_470"
  href="#Nt_470"><sup>[470]</sup></a> A more curious case is offered by the
  beet-plant, which, since its cultivation in France, has almost exactly
  doubled its yield of sugar. This has been effected by the most careful
  selection; the specific gravity of the roots being regularly tested, and
  the best roots saved for the production of seed.<a name="NtA_471"
  href="#Nt_471"><sup>[471]</sup></a></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Selection by Ancient and Semi-civilised People.</i></p>

  <p>In attributing so much importance to the selection of animals and
  plants, it may be objected that methodical selection would not have been
  carried on during ancient times. A distinguished naturalist considers it
  as absurd to suppose that semi-civilised people should have practised
  selection of any kind. Undoubtedly the principle has been systematically
  acknowledged and followed to a far greater extent within the last hundred
  years than at any former period, and a corresponding result has been
  gained; but it would be a great error to suppose, as we shall immediately
  see, that its importance was not recognised and acted on during the most
  ancient times, and by semi-civilised people. I should premise that many
  facts now to be given only show that care was taken in breeding; but when
  this is the case, selection is almost sure to be practised to a certain
  extent. We shall hereafter be enabled better to judge how far selection,
  when only occasionally carried on, by a few of the inhabitants of a
  country, will slowly produce a great effect.</p>

  <p>In a well-known passage in the thirtieth chapter of Genesis, rules are
  given for influencing, as was then thought possible, the colour of sheep;
  and speckled and dark breeds are spoken of as being kept separate. By the
  time of David the fleece was likened to snow. Youatt,<a name="NtA_472"
  href="#Nt_472"><sup>[472]</sup></a> who has discussed all the passages in
  relation to breeding in the Old Testament, concludes that <!-- Page 202
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>{202}</span>at this early
  period "some of the best principles of breeding must have been steadily
  and long pursued." It was ordered, according to Moses, that "Thou shalt
  not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind;" but mules were
  purchased,<a name="NtA_473" href="#Nt_473"><sup>[473]</sup></a> so that
  at this early period other nations must have crossed the horse and ass.
  It is said<a name="NtA_474" href="#Nt_474"><sup>[474]</sup></a> that
  Erichthonius, some generations before the Trojan war, had many
  brood-mares, "which by his care and judgment in the choice of stallions
  produced a breed of horses superior to any in the surrounding countries."
  Homer (Book v.) speaks of Æneas's horses as bred from mares which were
  put to the steeds of Laomedon. Plato, in his 'Republic,' says to Glaucus,
  "I see that you raise at your house a great many dogs for the chase. Do
  you take care about breeding and pairing them? Among animals of good
  blood, are there not always some which are superior to the rest?" To
  which Glaucus answers in the affirmative.<a name="NtA_475"
  href="#Nt_475"><sup>[475]</sup></a> Alexander the Great selected the
  finest Indian cattle to send to Macedonia to improve the breed.<a
  name="NtA_476" href="#Nt_476"><sup>[476]</sup></a> According to Pliny,<a
  name="NtA_477" href="#Nt_477"><sup>[477]</sup></a> King Pyrrhus had an
  especially valuable breed of oxen; and he did not suffer the bulls and
  cows to come together till four years old, that the breed might not
  degenerate. Virgil, in his Georgics (lib. iii.), gives as strong advice
  as any modern agriculturist could do, carefully to select the breeding
  stock; "to note the tribe, the lineage, and the sire; whom to reserve for
  husband of the herd;"&mdash;to brand the progeny;&mdash;to select sheep
  of the purest white, and to examine if their tongues are swarthy. We have
  seen that the Romans kept pedigrees of their pigeons, and this would have
  been a senseless proceeding had not great care been taken in breeding
  them. Columella gives detailed instructions about breeding fowls: "Let
  the breeding hens therefore be of a choice colour, a robust body,
  square-built, full-breasted, with large heads, with upright and
  bright-red combs. Those are believed to be the best bred which have five
  toes."<a name="NtA_478" href="#Nt_478"><sup>[478]</sup></a> According to
  Tacitus, the Celts attended to the races of their domestic animals; <!--
  Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>{203}</span>and
  Cæsar states that they paid high prices to merchants for fine imported
  horses.<a name="NtA_479" href="#Nt_479"><sup>[479]</sup></a> In regard to
  plants, Virgil speaks of yearly culling the largest seeds; and Celsus
  says, "where the corn and crop is but small, we must pick out the best
  ears of corn, and of them lay up our seed separately by itself."<a
  name="NtA_480" href="#Nt_480"><sup>[480]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Coming down the stream of time, we may be brief. At about the
  beginning of the ninth century Charlemagne expressly ordered his officers
  to take great care of his stallions; and if any proved bad or old, to
  forewarn him in good time before they were put to the mares.<a
  name="NtA_481" href="#Nt_481"><sup>[481]</sup></a> Even in a country so
  little civilised as Ireland during the ninth century, it would appear
  from some ancient verses,<a name="NtA_482"
  href="#Nt_482"><sup>[482]</sup></a> describing a ransom demanded by
  Cormac, that animals from particular places, or having a particular
  character, were valued. Thus it is said,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p>Athelstan, in 930, received as a present from Germany, running-horses;
  and he prohibited the exportation of English horses. King John imported
  "one hundred chosen stallions from Flanders."<a name="NtA_483"
  href="#Nt_483"><sup>[483]</sup></a> On June 16th, 1305, the Prince of
  Wales wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, begging for the loan of any
  choice stallion, and promising its return at the end of the season.<a
  name="NtA_484" href="#Nt_484"><sup>[484]</sup></a> There are numerous
  records at ancient periods in English history of the importation of
  choice animals of various kinds, and of foolish laws against their
  exportation. In the reigns of Henry VII. and VIII. it was ordered that
  the magistrates, at Michaelmas, should scour the heaths and commons, and
  destroy all mares beneath a certain size.<a name="NtA_485"
  href="#Nt_485"><sup>[485]</sup></a> Some of our earlier kings passed laws
  against the slaughtering rams of any good breed before they were seven
  years old, so that they <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page204"></a>{204}</span>might have time to breed. In Spain
  Cardinal Ximenes issued, in 1509, regulations on the <i>selection</i> of
  good rams for breeding.<a name="NtA_486"
  href="#Nt_486"><sup>[486]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Emperor Akbar Khan before the year 1600 is said to have
  "wonderfully improved" his pigeons by crossing the breeds; and this
  necessarily implies careful selection. About the same period the Dutch
  attended with the greatest care to the breeding of these birds. Belon in
  1555 says that good managers in France examined the colour of their
  goslings in order to get geese of a white colour and better kinds.
  Markham in 1631 tells the breeder "to elect the largest and goodliest
  conies," and enters into minute details. Even with respect to seeds of
  plants for the flower-garden, Sir J. Hanmer writing about the year 1660<a
  name="NtA_487" href="#Nt_487"><sup>[487]</sup></a> says, in "choosing
  seed, the best seed is the most weighty, and is had from the lustiest and
  most vigorous stems;" and he then gives rules about leaving only a few
  flowers on plants for seed; so that even such details were attended to in
  our flower-gardens two hundred years ago. In order to show that selection
  has been silently carried on in places where it would not have been
  expected, I may add that in the middle of the last century, in a remote
  part of North America, Mr. Cooper improved by careful selection all his
  vegetables, "so that they were greatly superior to those of any other
  person. When his radishes, for instance, are fit for use, he takes ten or
  twelve that he most approves, and plants them at least 100 yards from
  others that blossom at the same time. In the same manner he treats all
  his other plants, varying the circumstances according to their nature."<a
  name="NtA_488" href="#Nt_488"><sup>[488]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the great work on China published in the last century by the
  Jesuits, and which is chiefly compiled from ancient Chinese
  encyclopædias, it is said that with sheep "improving the breed consists
  in choosing with particular care the lambs which are destined for
  propagation, in nourishing them well, and in keeping the flocks
  separate." The same principles were applied by the Chinese to various
  plants and fruit-trees.<a name="NtA_489"
  href="#Nt_489"><sup>[489]</sup></a> An <!-- Page 205 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>{205}</span>imperial edict
  recommends the choice of seed of remarkable size; and selection was
  practised even by imperial hands, for it is said that the Ya-mi, or
  imperial rice, was noticed at an ancient period in a field by the Emperor
  Khang-hi, was saved and cultivated in his garden, and has since become
  valuable from being the only kind which will grow north of the Great
  Wall.<a name="NtA_490" href="#Nt_490"><sup>[490]</sup></a> Even with
  flowers, the tree pæony (<i>P. moutan</i>) has been cultivated, according
  to Chinese traditions, for 1400 years; between 200 and 300 varieties have
  been raised, which are cherished like tulips formerly were by the
  Dutch.<a name="NtA_491" href="#Nt_491"><sup>[491]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Turning now to semi-civilised people and to savages: it occurred to
  me, from what I had seen of several parts of South America, where fences
  do not exist, and where the animals are of little value, that there would
  be absolutely no care in breeding or selecting them; and this to a large
  extent is true. Roulin,<a name="NtA_492"
  href="#Nt_492"><sup>[492]</sup></a> however, describes in Colombia a
  naked race of cattle, which are not allowed to increase, on account of
  their delicate constitution. According to Azara<a name="NtA_493"
  href="#Nt_493"><sup>[493]</sup></a> horses are often born in Paraguay
  with curly hair; but, as the natives do not like them, they are
  destroyed. On the other hand, Azara states that a hornless bull, born in
  1770, was preserved and propagated its race. I was informed of the
  existence in Banda Oriental of a breed with reversed hair; and the
  extraordinary niata cattle first appeared and have since been kept
  distinct in La Plata. Hence certain conspicuous variations have been
  preserved, and others have been habitually destroyed, in these countries,
  which are so little favourable for careful selection. We have also seen
  that the inhabitants sometimes introduce cattle on their estates to
  prevent the evil effects of close interbreeding. On the other hand, I
  have heard on reliable authority that the Gauchos of the Pampas never
  take any pains in selecting the best bulls or stallions for breeding; and
  this probably accounts for the cattle and horses being remarkably uniform
  in character throughout the immense range of the Argentine republic.</p>

  <p>Looking to the Old World, in the Sahara Desert "The Touareg is as
  careful in the selection of his breeding Mahari <!-- Page 206 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>{206}</span>(a fine race of the
  dromedary) as the Arab is in that of his horse. The pedigrees are handed
  down, and many a dromedary can boast a genealogy far longer than the
  descendants of the Darley Arabian."<a name="NtA_494"
  href="#Nt_494"><sup>[494]</sup></a> According to Pallas the Mongolians
  endeavour to breed the Yaks or horse-tailed buffaloes with white tails,
  for these are sold to the Chinese mandarins as fly-flappers; and
  Moorcroft, about seventy years after Pallas, found that white-tailed
  animals were still selected for breeding.<a name="NtA_495"
  href="#Nt_495"><sup>[495]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We have seen in the chapter on the Dog that savages in different parts
  of North America and in Guiana cross their dogs with wild Canidæ, as did
  the ancient Gauls, according to Pliny. This was done to give their dogs
  strength and vigour, in the same way as the keepers in large warrens now
  sometimes cross their ferrets (as I have been informed by Mr. Yarrell)
  with the wild polecat, "to give them more devil." According to Varro, the
  wild ass was formerly caught and crossed with the tame animal to improve
  the breed, in the same manner as at the present day the natives of Java
  sometimes drive their cattle into the forests to cross with the wild
  Banteng (<i>Bos sondaicus</i>).<a name="NtA_496"
  href="#Nt_496"><sup>[496]</sup></a> In Northern Siberia, among the
  Ostyaks the dogs vary in markings in different districts, but in each
  place they are spotted black and white in a remarkably uniform manner;<a
  name="NtA_497" href="#Nt_497"><sup>[497]</sup></a> and from this fact
  alone we may infer careful breeding, more especially as the dogs of one
  locality are famed throughout the country for their superiority. I have
  heard of certain tribes of Esquimaux who take pride in their teams of
  dogs being uniformly coloured. In Guiana, as Sir R. Schomburgk informs
  me,<a name="NtA_498" href="#Nt_498"><sup>[498]</sup></a> the dogs of the
  Turuma Indians are highly valued and extensively bartered: the price of a
  good one is the same as that given for a wife: they are kept in a sort of
  cage, and the Indians "take great care when the female is in season to
  prevent her uniting with a dog of an inferior description." The Indians
  told Sir Robert that, if a dog proved bad or useless, <!-- Page 207
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>{207}</span>he was not
  killed, but was left to die from sheer neglect. Hardly any nation is more
  barbarous than the Fuegians, but I hear from Mr. Bridges, the Catechist
  to the Mission, that, "when these savages have a large, strong, and
  active bitch, they take care to put her to a fine dog, and even take care
  to feed her well, that her young may be strong and well favoured."</p>

  <p>In the interior of Africa, negroes, who have not associated with white
  men, show great anxiety to improve their animals: they "always choose the
  larger and stronger males for stock:" the Malakolo were much pleased at
  Livingstone's promise to send them a bull, and some Bakalolo carried a
  live cock all the way from Loanda into the interior.<a name="NtA_499"
  href="#Nt_499"><sup>[499]</sup></a> Further south on the same continent,
  Andersson states that he has known a Damara give two fine oxen for a dog
  which struck his fancy. The Damaras take great delight in having whole
  droves of cattle of the same colour, and they prize their oxen in
  proportion to the size of their horns. "The Namaquas have a perfect mania
  for a uniform team; and almost all the people of Southern Africa value
  their cattle next to their women, and take a pride in possessing animals
  that look high-bred." "They rarely or never make use of a handsome animal
  as a beast of burden."<a name="NtA_500"
  href="#Nt_500"><sup>[500]</sup></a> The power of discrimination which
  these savages possess is wonderful, and they can recognise to which tribe
  any cattle belong. Mr. Andersson further informs me that the natives
  frequently match a particular bull with a particular cow.</p>

  <p>The most curious case of selection by semi-civilised people, or indeed
  by any people, which I have found recorded, is that given by Garcilazo de
  la Vega, a descendant of the Incas, as having been practised in Peru
  before the country was subjugated by the Spaniards.<a name="NtA_501"
  href="#Nt_501"><sup>[501]</sup></a> The Incas annually held great hunts,
  when all the wild animals were driven from an immense circuit to a
  central point. The beasts of prey were first destroyed as injurious. The
  wild Guanacos and Vicunas were sheared; the old males and females killed,
  and the others set at liberty. The various kinds of deer were examined;
  the old males and females <!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page208"></a>{208}</span>were likewise killed; "but the young
  females, with a certain number of males, selected from the most beautiful
  and strong," were given their freedom. Here, then, we have selection by
  man aiding natural selection. So that the Incas followed exactly the
  reverse system of that which our Scottish sportsmen are accused of
  following, namely, of steadily killing the finest stags, thus causing the
  whole race to degenerate.<a name="NtA_502"
  href="#Nt_502"><sup>[502]</sup></a> In regard to the domesticated llamas
  and alpacas, they were separated in the time of the Incas according to
  colour; and if by chance one in a flock was born of the wrong colour, it
  was eventually put into another flock.</p>

  <p>In the genus Auchenia there are four forms,&mdash;the Guanaco and
  Vicuna, found wild and undoubtedly distinct species; the Llama and
  Alpaca, known only in a domesticated condition. These four animals appear
  so different, that most professed naturalists, especially those who have
  studied these animals in their native country, maintain that they are
  specifically distinct, notwithstanding that no one pretends to have seen
  a wild llama or alpaca. Mr. Ledger, however, who has closely studied
  these animals both in Peru and during their exportation to Australia, and
  who has made many experiments on their propagation, adduces arguments<a
  name="NtA_503" href="#Nt_503"><sup>[503]</sup></a> which seem to me
  conclusive, that the llama is the domesticated descendant of the guanaco,
  and the alpaca of the vicuna. And now that we know that these animals
  many centuries ago were systematically bred and selected, there is
  nothing surprising in the great amount of change which they have
  undergone.</p>

  <p>It appeared to me at one time probable that, though ancient and
  semi-civilised people might have attended to the improvement of their
  more useful animals in essential points, yet that they would have
  disregarded unimportant characters. But human nature is the same
  throughout the world: fashion everywhere reigns supreme, and man is apt
  to value whatever he may chance to possess. We have seen that in South
  America the niata cattle, which certainly are not made useful by their
  shortened faces and upturned nostrils, have been preserved. The Damaras
  of South Africa value their cattle for uniformity <!-- Page 209 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>{209}</span>of colour and
  enormously long horns. The Mongolians value their yaks for their white
  tails. And I shall now show that there is hardly any peculiarity in our
  most useful animals which, from fashion, superstition, or some other
  motive, has not been valued, and consequently preserved. With respect to
  cattle, "an early record," according to Youatt,<a name="NtA_504"
  href="#Nt_504"><sup>[504]</sup></a> "speaks of a hundred white cows with
  red ears being demanded as a compensation by the princes of North and
  South Wales. If the cattle were of a dark or black colour, 150 were to be
  presented." So that colour was attended to in Wales before its
  subjugation by England. In Central Africa, an ox that beats the ground
  with its tail is killed; and in South Africa some of the Damaras will not
  eat the flesh of a spotted ox. The Kaffirs value an animal with a musical
  voice; and "at a sale in British Kaffraria the low of a heifer excited so
  much admiration that a sharp competition sprung up for her possession,
  and she realised a considerable price."<a name="NtA_505"
  href="#Nt_505"><sup>[505]</sup></a> With respect to sheep, the Chinese
  prefer rams without horns; the Tartars prefer them with spirally wound
  horns, because the hornless are thought to lose courage.<a name="NtA_506"
  href="#Nt_506"><sup>[506]</sup></a> Some of the Damaras will not eat the
  flesh of hornless sheep. In regard to horses, at the end of the fifteenth
  century animals of the colour described as <i>liart pommé</i> were most
  valued in France. The Arabs have a proverb, "Never buy a horse with four
  white feet, for he carries his shroud with him;"<a name="NtA_507"
  href="#Nt_507"><sup>[507]</sup></a> the Arabs also, as we have seen,
  despise dun-coloured horses. So with dogs, Xenophon and others at an
  ancient period were prejudiced in favour of certain colours; and "white
  or slate-coloured hunting dogs were not esteemed."<a name="NtA_508"
  href="#Nt_508"><sup>[508]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Turning to poultry, the old Roman gourmands thought that the liver of
  a white goose was the most savoury. In Paraguay black-skinned fowls are
  kept because they are thought to be more productive, and their flesh the
  most proper for invalids.<a name="NtA_509"
  href="#Nt_509"><sup>[509]</sup></a> In Guiana, as I am informed by Sir R.
  Schomburgk, the aborigines will not eat the flesh or eggs of the fowl,
  but two <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page210"></a>{210}</span>races are kept distinct merely for
  ornament. In the Philippines, no less than nine sub-varieties of the game
  cock are kept and named, so that they must be separately bred.</p>

  <p>At the present time in Europe, the smallest peculiarities are
  carefully attended to in our most useful animals, either from fashion, or
  as a mark of purity of blood. Many examples could be given, two will
  suffice. "In the Western counties of England the prejudice against a
  white pig is nearly as strong as against a black one in Yorkshire." In
  one of the Berkshire sub-breeds, it is said, "the white should be
  confined to four white feet, a white spot between the eyes, and a few
  white hairs behind each shoulder." Mr. Saddler possessed "three hundred
  pigs, every one of which was marked in this manner."<a name="NtA_510"
  href="#Nt_510"><sup>[510]</sup></a> Marshall, towards the close of the
  last century, in speaking of a change in one of the Yorkshire breeds of
  cattle, says the horns have been considerably modified, as "a clean,
  small, sharp horn has been <i>fashionable</i> for the last twenty
  years."<a name="NtA_511" href="#Nt_511"><sup>[511]</sup></a> In a part of
  Germany the cattle of the Race de Gfoehl are valued for many good
  qualities, but they must have horns of a particular curvature and tint,
  so much so that mechanical means are applied if they take a wrong
  direction; but the inhabitants "consider it of the highest importance
  that the nostrils of the bull should be flesh-coloured, and the eyelashes
  light; this is an indispensable condition. A calf with blue nostrils
  would not be purchased, or purchased at a very low price."<a
  name="NtA_512" href="#Nt_512"><sup>[512]</sup></a> Therefore let no man
  say that any point or character is too trifling to be methodically
  attended to and selected by breeders.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Unconscious Selection.</i>&mdash;By this term I mean, as already
  more than once explained, the preservation by man of the most valued, and
  the destruction of the least valued individuals, without any conscious
  intention on his part of altering the breed. It is difficult to offer
  direct proofs of the results which follow from this kind of selection;
  but the indirect evidence is abundant. In fact, except that in the one
  case man acts intentionally, and in the other unintentionally, there is
  little difference between <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page211"></a>{211}</span>methodical and unconscious selection. In
  both cases man preserves the animals which are most useful or pleasing to
  him, and destroys or neglects the others. But no doubt a far more rapid
  result follows from methodical than from unconscious selection. The
  "roguing" of plants by gardeners, and the destruction by law in Henry
  VIII.'s reign of all under-sized mares, are instances of a process the
  reverse of selection in the ordinary sense of the word, but leading to
  the same general result. The influence of the destruction of individuals
  having a particular character is well shown by the necessity of killing
  every lamb with a trace of black about it, in order to keep the flock
  white; or again, by the effects on the average height of the men of
  France of the destructive wars of Napoleon, by which many tall men were
  killed, the short ones being left to be the fathers of families. This at
  least is the conclusion of those who have closely studied the subject of
  the conscription; and it is certain that since Napoleon's time the
  standard for the army has been lowered two or three times.</p>

  <p>Unconscious selection so blends into methodical that it is scarcely
  possible to separate them. When a fancier long ago first happened to
  notice a pigeon with an unusually short beak, or one with the
  tail-feathers unusually developed, although he bred from these birds with
  the distinct intention of propagating the variety, yet he could not have
  intended to make a short-faced tumbler or a fantail, and was far from
  knowing that he had made the first step towards this end. If he could
  have seen the final result, he would have been struck with astonishment,
  but, from what we know of the habits of fanciers, probably not with
  admiration. Our English carriers, barbs, and short-faced tumblers have
  been greatly modified in the same manner, as we may infer both from the
  historical evidence given in the chapters on the Pigeon, and from the
  comparison of birds brought from distant countries.</p>

  <p>So it has been with dogs; our present fox-hounds differ from the old
  English hound; our greyhounds have become lighter; the wolf-dog, which
  belonged to the greyhound class, has become extinct; the Scotch
  deer-hound has been modified, and is now rare. Our bulldogs differ from
  those which were formerly used for baiting bulls. Our pointers and
  Newfoundlands do not <!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page212"></a>{212}</span>closely resemble any native dog now found
  in the countries whence they were brought, These changes have been
  effected partly by crosses; but in every case the result has been
  governed by the strictest selection. Nevertheless there is no reason to
  suppose that man intentionally and methodically made the breeds exactly
  what they now are. As our horses became fleeter, and the country more
  cultivated and smoother, fleeter fox-hounds were desired and produced,
  but probably without any one distinctly foreseeing what they would
  become. Our pointers and setters, the latter almost certainly descended
  from large spaniels, have been greatly modified in accordance with
  fashion and the desire for increased speed. Wolves have become extinct,
  deer have become rarer, bulls are no longer baited, and the corresponding
  breeds of the dog have answered to the change. But we may feel almost
  sure that when, for instance, bulls were no longer baited, no man said to
  himself, I will now breed my dogs of smaller size, and thus create the
  present race. As circumstances changed, men unconsciously and slowly
  modified their course of selection.</p>

  <p>With race-horses selection for swiftness has been followed
  methodically, and our horses can now easily beat their progenitors. The
  increased size and different appearance of the English race-horse led a
  good observer in India to ask, "Could any one in this year of 1856,
  looking at our race-horses, conceive that they were the result of the
  union of the Arab horse and the African mare?"<a name="NtA_513"
  href="#Nt_513"><sup>[513]</sup></a> This change has, it is probable, been
  largely effected through unconscious selection, that is, by the general
  wish to breed as fine horses as possible in each generation, combined
  with training and high feeding, but without any intention to give to them
  their present appearance. According to Youatt,<a name="NtA_514"
  href="#Nt_514"><sup>[514]</sup></a> the introduction in Oliver Cromwell's
  time of three celebrated Eastern stallions speedily affected the English
  breed; "so that Lord Harleigh, one of the old school, complained that the
  great horse was fast disappearing." This is an excellent proof how
  carefully selection must have been attended to; for without such care,
  all traces of so small an infusion of Eastern blood would soon have been
  absorbed and <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page213"></a>{213}</span>lost. Notwithstanding that the climate of
  England has never been esteemed particularly favourable to the horse, yet
  long-continued selection, both methodical and unconscious, together with
  that practised by the Arabs during a still longer and earlier period, has
  ended in giving us the best breed of horses in the world. Macaulay<a
  name="NtA_515" href="#Nt_515"><sup>[515]</sup></a> remarks, "Two men
  whose authority on such subjects was held in great esteem, the Duke of
  Newcastle and Sir John Fenwick, pronounced that the meanest hack ever
  imported from Tangier would produce a finer progeny than could be
  expected from the best sire of our native breed. They would not readily
  have believed that a time would come when the princes and nobles of
  neighbouring lands would be as eager to obtain horses from England as
  ever the English had been to obtain horses from Barbary."</p>

  <p>The London dray-horse, which differs so much in appearance from any
  natural species, and which from its size has so astonished many Eastern
  princes, was probably formed by the heaviest and most powerful animals
  having been selected during many generations in Flanders and England, but
  without the least intention or expectation of creating a horse such as we
  now see. If we go back to an early period of history, we behold in the
  antique Greek statues, as Schaaffhausen has remarked,<a name="NtA_516"
  href="#Nt_516"><sup>[516]</sup></a> a horse equally unlike a race or dray
  horse, and differing from any existing breed.</p>

  <p>The results of unconscious selection, in an early stage, are well
  shown in the difference between the flocks descended from the same stock,
  but separately reared by careful breeders. Youatt gives an excellent
  instance of this fact in the sheep belonging to Messrs. Buckley and
  Burgess, which "have been purely bred from the original stock of Mr.
  Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion existing in
  the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of
  either flock has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr.
  Bakewell's flock; yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these
  two gentlemen is so great, that they have the appearance of being quite
  different varieties."<a name="NtA_517"
  href="#Nt_517"><sup>[517]</sup></a> I have seen several analogous and
  <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span>well-marked cases with pigeons: for
  instance, I had a family of barbs, descended from those long bred by Sir
  J. Sebright, and another family long bred by another fancier, and the two
  families plainly differed from each other. Nathusius&mdash;and a more
  competent witness could not be cited&mdash;observes that, though the
  Shorthorns are remarkably uniform inn appearance (except in colouring),
  yet that the individual character and wishes of each breeder become
  impressed on his cattle, so that different herds differ slightly from
  each other.<a name="NtA_518" href="#Nt_518"><sup>[518]</sup></a> The
  Hereford cattle assumed their present well-marked character soon after
  the year 1769, through careful selection by Mr. Tomkins,<a name="NtA_519"
  href="#Nt_519"><sup>[519]</sup></a> and the breed has lately split into
  two strains&mdash;one strain having a white face, and differing slightly,
  it is said,<a name="NtA_520" href="#Nt_520"><sup>[520]</sup></a> in some
  other points; but there is no reason to believe that this split, the
  origin of which is unknown, was intentionally made; it may with much more
  probability be attributed to different breeders having attended to
  different points. So again, the Berkshire breed of swine in the year 1810
  had greatly changed from what it had been in 1780; and since 1810 at
  least two distinct sub-breeds have borne this same name.<a name="NtA_521"
  href="#Nt_521"><sup>[521]</sup></a> When we bear in mind how rapidly all
  animals increase, and that some must be annually slaughtered and some
  saved for breeding, then, if the same breeder during a long course of
  years deliberately settles which shall be saved and which shall be
  killed, it is almost inevitable that his individual frame of mind will
  influence the character of his stock, without his having had any
  intention to modify the breed or form a new strain.</p>

  <p>Unconscious selection in the strictest sense of the word, that is, the
  saving of the more useful animals and the neglect or slaughter of the
  less useful, without any thought of the future, must have gone on
  occasionally from the remotest period and amongst the most barbarous
  nations. Savages often suffer from famines, and are sometimes expelled by
  war from their own homes. In such cases it can hardly be doubted that
  they would save their most useful animals. When the Fuegians <!-- Page
  215 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>{215}</span>are hard
  pressed by want, they kill their old women for food rather than their
  dogs; for, as we were assured, "old women no use&mdash;dogs catch
  otters." The same sound sense would surely lead them to preserve their
  more useful dogs when still harder pressed by famine. Mr. Oldfield, who
  has seen so much of the aborigines of Australia, informs me that "they
  are all very glad to get a European kangaroo dog, and several instances
  have been known of the father killing his own infant that the mother
  might suckle the much-prized puppy." Different kinds of dogs would be
  useful to the Australian for hunting opossums and kangaroos, and to the
  Fuegian for catching fish and otters; and the occasional preservation in
  the two countries of the most useful animals would ultimately lead to the
  formation of two widely distinct breeds.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>With plants, from the earliest dawn of civilisation, the best variety
  which at each period was known would generally have been cultivated and
  its seeds occasionally sown; so that there will have been some selection
  from an extremely remote period, but without any prefixed standard of
  excellence or thought of the future. We at the present day profit by a
  course of selection occasionally and unconsciously carried on during
  thousands of years. This is proved in an interesting manner by Oswald
  Heer's researches on the lake-inhabitants of Switzerland, as given in a
  former chapter; for he shows that the grain and seed of our present
  varieties of wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, lentils, and poppy, exceed
  in size those which were cultivated in Switzerland during the Neolithic
  and Bronze periods. These ancient people, during the Neolithic period,
  possessed also a crab considerably larger than that now growing wild on
  the Jura.<a name="NtA_522" href="#Nt_522"><sup>[522]</sup></a> The pears
  described by Pliny were evidently extremely inferior in quality to our
  present pears. We can realise the effects of long-continued selection and
  cultivation in another way, for would any one in his senses expect to
  raise a first-rate apple from the seed of a truly wild crab, or a
  luscious melting pear from the wild pear? Alphonse De Candolle informs me
  that he has lately seen on an ancient mosaic at Rome a representation of
  <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>{216}</span>the melon; and as the Romans, who were
  such gourmands, are silent on this fruit, he infers that the melon has
  been greatly ameliorated since the classical period.</p>

  <p>Coming to later times, Buffon,<a name="NtA_523"
  href="#Nt_523"><sup>[523]</sup></a> on comparing the flowers, fruit, and
  vegetables which were then cultivated, with some excellent drawings made
  a hundred and fifty years previously, was struck with surprise at the
  great improvement which had been effected; and remarks that these ancient
  flowers and vegetables would now be rejected, not only by a florist but
  by a village gardener. Since the time of Buffon the work of improvement
  has steadily and rapidly gone on. Every florist who compares our present
  flowers with those figured in books published not long since, is
  astonished at the change. A well-known amateur,<a name="NtA_524"
  href="#Nt_524"><sup>[524]</sup></a> in speaking of the varieties of
  Pelargonium raised by Mr. Garth only twenty-two years before, remarks,
  "what a rage they excited: surely we had attained perfection, it was
  said; and now not one of the flowers of those days will be looked at. But
  none the less is the debt of gratitude which we owe to those who saw what
  was to be done, and did it." Mr. Paul, the well-known horticulturist, in
  writing of the same flower,<a name="NtA_525"
  href="#Nt_525"><sup>[525]</sup></a> says he remembers when young being
  delighted with the portraits in Sweet's work; "but what are they in point
  of beauty compared with the Pelargoniums of this day? Here again nature
  did not advance by leaps; the improvement was gradual, and, if we had
  neglected those very gradual advances, we must have foregone the present
  grand results." How well this practical horticulturist appreciates and
  illustrates the gradual and accumulative force of selection! The Dahlia
  has advanced in beauty in a like manner; the line of improvement being
  guided by fashion, and by the successive modifications which the flower
  slowly underwent.<a name="NtA_526" href="#Nt_526"><sup>[526]</sup></a> A
  steady and gradual change has been noticed in many other flowers: thus an
  old florist,<a name="NtA_527" href="#Nt_527"><sup>[527]</sup></a> after
  describing the leading varieties of the Pink which were grown in 1813,
  adds, "the pinks of those days would now be scarcely grown as
  border-flowers." The improvement of <!-- Page 217 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>{217}</span>so many flowers and the
  number of the varieties which have been raised is all the more striking
  when we hear that the earliest known flower-garden in Europe, namely at
  Padua, dates only from the year 1545.<a name="NtA_528"

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Effects of Selection, as shown by the parts most valued by man
  presenting the greatest amount of Difference.</i>&mdash;The power of
  long-continued selection, whether methodical or unconscious, or both
  combined, is well shown in a general way, namely, by the comparison of
  the differences between the varieties of distinct species, which are
  valued for different parts, such as for the leaves, or stems, or tubers,
  the seed, or fruit, or flowers. Whatever part man values most, that part
  will be found to present the greatest amount of difference. With trees
  cultivated for their fruit, Sageret remarks that the fruit is larger than
  in the parent-species, whilst with those cultivated for the seed, as with
  nuts, walnuts, almonds, chesnuts, &amp;c., it is the seed itself which is
  larger; and he accounts for this fact by the fruit in the one case, and
  by the seed in the other, having been carefully attended to and selected
  during many ages. Gallesio has made the same observation. Godron insists
  on the diversity of the tuber in the potato, of the bulb in the onion,
  and of the fruit in the melon; and on the close similarity in these same
  plants of the other parts.<a name="NtA_529"
  href="#Nt_529"><sup>[529]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In order to judge how far my own impression on this subject was
  correct, I cultivated numerous varieties of the same species close to
  each other. The comparison of the amount of difference between widely
  different organs is necessarily vague; I will therefore give the results
  in only a few cases. We have previously seen in the ninth chapter how
  greatly the varieties of the cabbage differ in their foliage and stems,
  which are the selected parts, and how closely they resembled each other
  in their flowers, capsules, and seeds. In seven varieties of the radish,
  the roots differed greatly in colour and shape, but no difference <!--
  Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page218"></a>{218}</span>whatever could be detected in their
  foliage, flowers, or seeds. Now what a contrast is presented, if we
  compare the flowers of the varieties of these two plants with those of
  any species cultivated in our flower-gardens for ornament; or if we
  compare their seeds with those of the varieties of maize, peas, beans,
  &amp;c., which are valued and cultivated for their seeds. In the ninth
  chapter it was shown that the varieties of the pea differ but little
  except in the tallness of the plant, moderately in the shape of the pod,
  and greatly in the pea itself, and these are all selected points. The
  varieties, however, of the <i>Pois sans parchemin</i> differ much more in
  their pods, and these are eaten and valued. I cultivated twelve varieties
  of the common bean; one alone, the Dwarf Fan, differed considerably in
  general appearance; two differed in the colour of their flowers, one
  being an albino, and the other being wholly instead of partially purple;
  several differed considerably in the shape and size of the pod, but far
  more in the bean itself, and this is the valued and selected part.
  Toker's bean, for instance, is twice-and-a-half as long and broad as the
  horse-bean, and is much thinner and of a different shape.</p>

  <p>The varieties of the gooseberry, as formerly described, differ much in
  their fruit, but hardly perceptibly in their flowers or organs of
  vegetation. With the plum, the differences likewise appear to be greater
  in the fruit than in the flowers or leaves. On the other hand, the seed
  of the strawberry, which corresponds with the fruit of the plum, differs
  hardly at all; whilst every one knows how greatly the fruit&mdash;that
  is, the enlarged receptacle&mdash;differs in the several varieties. In
  apples, pears, and peaches the flowers and leaves differ considerably,
  but not, as far as I can judge, in proportion with the fruit. The Chinese
  double-flowering peaches, on the other hand, show that varieties of this
  tree have been formed, which differ more in the flower than in fruit. If,
  as is highly probable, the peach is the modified descendant of the
  almond, a surprising amount of change has been effected in the same
  species, in the fleshy covering of the former and in the kernels of the
  latter.</p>

  <p>When parts stand in such close relation to each other as the fleshy
  covering of the fruit (whatever its homological nature may be) and the
  seed, when one part is modified, so generally is the other, but by no
  means necessarily in the same degree. With <!-- Page 219 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>{219}</span>the plum-tree, for
  instance, some varieties produce plums which are nearly alike, but
  include stones extremely dissimilar in shape; whilst conversely other
  varieties produce dissimilar fruit with barely distinguishable stones;
  and generally the stones, though they have never been subjected to
  selection, differ greatly in the several varieties of the plum. In other
  cases organs which are not manifestly related, through some unknown bond
  vary together, and are consequently liable, without any intention on
  man's part, to be simultaneously acted on by selection. Thus the
  varieties of the stock (Matthiola) have been selected solely for the
  beauty of their flowers, but the seeds differ greatly in colour and
  somewhat in size. Varieties of the lettuce have been selected solely on
  account of their leaves, yet produce seeds which likewise differ in
  colour. Generally, through the law of correlation, when a variety differs
  greatly from its fellow-varieties in any one character, it differs to a
  certain extent in several other characters. I observed this fact when I
  cultivated together many varieties of the same species, for I used first
  to make a list of the varieties which differed most from each other in
  their foliage and manner of growth, afterwards of those that differed
  most in their flowers, then in their seed-capsules, and lastly in their
  mature seed; and I found that the same names generally occurred in two,
  three, or four of the successive lists. Nevertheless the greatest amount
  of difference between the varieties was always exhibited, as far as I
  could judge, by that part or organ for which the plant was
  cultivated.</p>

  <p>When we bear in mind that each plant was at first cultivated because
  useful to man, and that its variation was a subsequent, often a long
  subsequent, event, we cannot explain the greater amount of diversity in
  the valuable parts by supposing that species endowed with an especial
  tendency to vary in any particular manner, were originally chosen. We
  must attribute the result to the variations in these parts having been
  successively preserved, and thus continually augmented; whilst other
  variations, excepting such as inevitably appeared through correlation,
  were neglected and lost. Hence we may infer that most plants might be
  made, through long-continued selection, to yield races as different from
  each other in any character <!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page220"></a>{220}</span>as they now are in those parts for which
  they are valued and cultivated.</p>

  <p>With animals we see something of the same kind; but they have not been
  domesticated in sufficient number or yielded sufficient varieties for a
  fair comparison. Sheep are valued for their wool, and the wool differs
  much more in the several races than the hair in cattle. Neither sheep,
  goats, European cattle, nor pigs are valued for their fleetness or
  strength; and we do not possess breeds differing in these respects like
  the race-horse and dray-horse. But fleetness and strength are valued in
  camels and dogs; and we have with the former the swift dromedary and
  heavy camel; with the latter the greyhound and mastiff. But dogs are
  valued even in a higher degree for their mental qualities and senses; and
  every one knows how greatly the races differ in these respects. On the
  other hand, where the dog is valued solely to serve for food, as in the
  Polynesian islands and China, it is described as an extremely stupid
  animal.<a name="NtA_530" href="#Nt_530"><sup>[530]</sup></a> Blumenbach
  remarks that "many dogs, such as the badger-dog, have a build so marked
  and so appropriate for particular purposes, that I should find it very
  difficult to persuade myself that this astonishing figure was an
  accidental consequence of degeneration."<a name="NtA_531"
  href="#Nt_531"><sup>[531]</sup></a> But had Blumenbach reflected on the
  great principle of selection, he would not have used the term
  degeneration, and he would not have been astonished that dogs and other
  animals should become excellently adapted for the service of man.</p>

  <p>On the whole we may conclude that whatever part or character is most
  valued&mdash;whether the leaves, stems, tubers, bulbs, flowers, fruit, or
  seed of plants, or the size, strength, fleetness, hairy covering, or
  intellect of animals&mdash;that character will almost invariably be found
  to present the greatest amount of difference both in kind and degree. And
  this result may be safely attributed to man having preserved during a
  long course of generations the variations which were useful to him, and
  neglected the others.</p>

  <p>I will conclude this chapter by some remarks on an important subject.
  With animals such as the giraffe, of which <!-- Page 221 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>{221}</span>the whole structure is
  admirably co-ordinated for certain purposes, it has been supposed that
  all the parts must have been simultaneously modified; and it has been
  argued that, on the principle of natural selection, this is scarcely
  possible. But in thus arguing, it has been tacitly assumed that the
  variations must have been abrupt and great. No doubt, if the neck of a
  ruminant were suddenly to become greatly elongated, the fore limbs and
  back would have to be simultaneously strengthened and modified; but it
  cannot be denied that an animal might have its neck, or head, or tongue,
  or fore-limbs elongated a very little without any corresponding
  modification in other parts of the body; and animals thus slightly
  modified would, during a dearth, have a slight advantage, and be enabled
  to browse on higher twigs, and thus survive. A few mouthfuls more or less
  every day would make all the difference between life and death. By the
  repetition of the same process, and by the occasional intercrossing of
  the survivors, there would be some progress, slow and fluctuating though
  it would be, towards the admirably co-ordinated structure of the giraffe.
  If the short-faced tumbler-pigeon, with its small conical beak, globular
  head, rounded body, short wings, and small feet&mdash;characters which
  appear all in harmony&mdash;had been a natural species, its whole
  structure would have been viewed as well fitted for its life; but in this
  case we know that inexperienced breeders are urged to attend to point
  after point, and not to attempt improving the whole structure at the same
  time. Look at the greyhound, that perfect image of grace, symmetry, and
  vigour; no natural species can boast of a more admirably co-ordinated
  structure, with its tapering head, slim body, deep chest, tucked-up
  abdomen, rat-like tail, and long muscular limbs, all adapted for extreme
  fleetness, and for running down weak prey. Now, from what we see of the
  variability of animals, and from what we know of the method which
  different men follow in improving their stock&mdash;some chiefly
  attending to one point, others to another point, others again correcting
  defects by crosses, and so forth&mdash;we may feel assured that if we
  could see the long line of ancestors of a first-rate greyhound, up to its
  wild wolf-like progenitor, we should behold an infinite number of the
  finest gradations, sometimes in one character and sometimes in another,
  but all leading towards our <!-- Page 222 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page222"></a>{222}</span>present perfect type. By small and
  doubtful steps such as these, nature, as we may confidently believe, has
  progressed on her grand march of improvement and development.</p>

  <p>A similar line of reasoning is as applicable to separate organs as to
  the whole organisation. A writer<a name="NtA_532"
  href="#Nt_532"><sup>[532]</sup></a> has recently maintained that "it is
  probably no exaggeration to suppose that, in order to improve such an
  organ as the eye at all, it must be improved in ten different ways at
  once. And the improbability of any complex organ being produced and
  brought to perfection in any such way is an improbability of the same
  kind and degree as that of producing a poem or a mathematical
  demonstration by throwing letters at random on a table." If the eye were
  abruptly and greatly modified, no doubt many parts would have to be
  simultaneously altered, in order that the organ should remain
  serviceable.</p>

  <p>But is this the case with smaller changes? There are persons who can
  see distinctly only in a dull light, and this condition depends, I
  believe, on the abnormal sensitiveness of the retina, and is known to be
  inherited. Now, if a bird, for instance, received some great advantage
  from seeing well in the twilight, all the individuals with the most
  sensitive retina would succeed best and be the most likely to survive;
  and why should not all those which happened to have the eye itself a
  little larger, or the pupil capable of greater dilatation, be likewise
  preserved, whether or not these modifications were strictly simultaneous?
  These individuals would subsequently intercross and blend their
  respective advantages. By such slight successive changes, the eye of a
  diurnal bird would be brought into the condition of that of an owl, which
  has often been advanced as an excellent instance of adaptation.
  Short-sight, which is often inherited, permits a person to see distinctly
  a minute object at so near a distance that it would be indistinct to
  ordinary eyes; and here we have a capacity which might be serviceable
  under certain conditions, abruptly gained. The Fuegians on board the <!--
  Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page223"></a>{223}</span>Beagle could certainly see distant objects
  more distinctly than our sailors with all their long practice; I do not
  know whether this depends on nervous sensitiveness or on the power of
  adjustment in the focus; but this capacity for distant vision might, it
  is probable, be slightly augmented by successive modifications of either
  kind. Amphibious animals, which are enabled to see both in the water and
  in the air, require and possess, as M. Plateau has shown,<a
  name="NtA_533" href="#Nt_533"><sup>[533]</sup></a> eyes constructed on
  the following plan: "the cornea is always flat, or at least much
  flattened in front of the crystalline and over a space equal to the
  diameter of that lens, whilst the lateral portions may be much curved."
  The crystalline is very nearly a sphere, and the humours have nearly the
  same density as water. Now, as a terrestrial animal slowly became more
  and more aquatic in its habits, very slight changes, first in the
  curvature of the cornea or crystalline, and then in the density of the
  humours, or conversely, might successively occur, and would be
  advantageous to the animal whilst under water, without serious detriment
  to its power of vision in the air. It is of course impossible to
  conjecture by what steps the fundamental structure of the eye in the
  Vertebrata was originally acquired, for we know absolutely nothing about
  this organ in the first progenitors of the class. With respect to the
  lowest animals in the scale, the transitional states through which the
  eye at first probably passed, can by the aid of analogy be indicated, as
  I have attempted to show in my 'Origin of Species.'<a name="NtA_534"

  <p><i>Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest, as affecting
  domestic productions.</i>&mdash;We know little on this head. But as
  animals kept by savages have to provide their own food, either entirely
  or to a large extent, throughout the year, it can hardly be doubted that,
  in different countries, varieties differing in constitution and in
  various characters would succeed best, and so be naturally selected.
  Hence perhaps it is that the few domesticated animals kept by savages
  partake, as has been remarked by more than one writer, of the wild
  appearance of their masters, and likewise resemble natural species. Even
  in long-civilised countries, at least in the wilder parts, natural
  selection must act on our domestic races. It is obvious that varieties,
  having very different habits, constitution, and structure, would succeed
  best on mountains and on rich lowland pastures. For example, the improved
  Leicester sheep were formerly taken to the Lammermuir Hills; but an
  intelligent sheep-master reported that "our coarse lean pastures were
  unequal to the task of supporting such heavy-bodied sheep; and they
  gradually dwindled away into less and less bulk: <!-- Page 225 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>{225}</span>each generation was
  inferior to the preceding one; and when the spring was severe, seldom
  more than two-thirds of the lambs survived the ravages of the storms."<a
  name="NtA_535" href="#Nt_535"><sup>[535]</sup></a> So with the mountain
  cattle of North Wales and the Hebrides, it has been found that they could
  not withstand being crossed with the larger and more delicate lowland
  breeds. Two French naturalists, in describing the horses of Circassia,
  remark that, subjected as they are to extreme vicissitudes of climate,
  having to search for scanty pasture, and exposed to constant danger from
  wolves, the strongest and most vigorous alone survive.<a name="NtA_536"
  href="#Nt_536"><sup>[536]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Every one must have been struck with the surpassing grace, strength,
  and vigour of the Game-cock, with its bold and confident air, its long,
  yet firm neck, compact body, powerful and closely pressed wings, muscular
  thighs, strong beak massive at the base, dense and sharp spurs set low on
  the legs for delivering the fatal blow, and its compact, glossy, and
  mail-like plumage serving as a defence. Now the English game-cock has not
  only been improved during many years by man's careful selection, but in
  addition, as Mr. Tegetmeier has remarked,<a name="NtA_537"
  href="#Nt_537"><sup>[537]</sup></a> by a kind of natural selection, for
  the strongest, most active and courageous birds have stricken down their
  antagonists in the cockpit, generation after generation, and have
  subsequently served as the progenitors of their kind.</p>

  <p>In Great Britain, in former times, almost every district had its own
  breed of cattle and sheep; "they were indigenous to the soil, climate,
  and pasturage of the locality on which they grazed: they seemed to have
  been formed for it and by it."<a name="NtA_538"
  href="#Nt_538"><sup>[538]</sup></a> But in this case we are quite unable
  to disentangle the effects of the direct action of the conditions of
  life,&mdash;of use or habit&mdash;of natural selection&mdash;and of that
  kind of selection which we have seen is occasionally and unconsciously
  followed by man even during the rudest periods of history.</p>

  <p>Let us now look to the action of natural selection on special
  characters. Although nature is difficult to resist, yet man often strives
  against her power, and sometimes, as we shall see, with <!-- Page 226
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>{226}</span>success. From
  the facts to be given, it will also be seen that natural selection would
  powerfully affect many of our domestic productions if left unprotected.
  This is a point of much interest, for we thus learn that differences
  apparently of very slight importance would certainly determine the
  survival of a form when forced to struggle for its own existence. It may
  have occurred to some naturalists, as it formerly did to me, that, though
  selection acting under natural conditions would determine the structure
  of all important organs, yet that it could not affect characters which
  are esteemed by us of little importance; but this is an error to which we
  are eminently liable, from our ignorance of what characters are of real
  value to each living creature.</p>

  <p>When man attempts to breed an animal with some serious defect in
  structure, or in the mutual relation of parts, he will either partially
  or completely fail, or encounter much difficulty; and this is in fact a
  form of natural selection. We have seen that the attempt was once made in
  Yorkshire to breed cattle with enormous buttocks, but the cows perished
  so often in bringing forth their calves, that the attempt had to be given
  up. In rearing short-faced tumblers, Mr. Eaton says,<a name="NtA_539"
  href="#Nt_539"><sup>[539]</sup></a> "I am convinced that better head and
  beak birds have perished in the shell than ever were hatched; the reason
  being that the amazingly short-faced bird cannot reach and break the
  shell with its beak, and so perishes." Here is a more curious case, in
  which natural selection comes into play only at long intervals of time:
  during ordinary seasons the Niata cattle can graze as well as others, but
  occasionally, as from 1827 to 1830, the plains of La Plata suffer from
  long-continued droughts and the pasture is burnt up; at such times common
  cattle and horses perish by the thousand, but many survive by browsing on
  twigs, reeds, &amp;c.; this the Niata cattle cannot so well effect from
  their upturned jaws and the shape of their lips; consequently, if not
  attended to, they perish before the other cattle. In Colombia, according
  to Roulin, there is a breed of nearly hairless cattle, called Pelones;
  these succeed in their native hot district, but are found too tender for
  the Cordillera; in this case, natural selection <!-- Page 227 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>{227}</span>determines only the
  range of the variety. It is obvious that a host of artificial races could
  never survive in a state of nature;&mdash;such as Italian
  greyhounds,&mdash;hairless and almost toothless Turkish
  dogs,&mdash;fantail pigeons, which cannot fly well against a strong
  wind,&mdash;barbs with their vision impeded by their
  eye-wattle,&mdash;Polish fowls with their vision impeded by their great
  topknots,&mdash;hornless bulls and rams which consequently cannot cope
  with other males, and thus have a poor chance of leaving
  offspring,&mdash;seedless plants, and many other such cases.</p>

  <p>Colour is generally esteemed by the systematic naturalist as
  unimportant: let us, therefore, see how far it indirectly affects our
  domestic productions, and how far it would affect them if they were left
  exposed to the full force of natural selection. In a future chapter I
  shall have to show that constitutional peculiarities of the strangest
  kind, entailing liability to the action of certain poisons, are
  correlated with the colour of the skin. I will here give a single case,
  on the high authority of Professor Wyman; he informs me that, being
  surprised at all the pigs in a part of Virginia being black, he made
  inquiries, and ascertained that these animals feed on the roots of the
  <i>Lachnanthes tinctoria</i>, which colours their bones pink, and,
  excepting in the case of the black varieties, causes the hoofs to drop
  off. Hence, as one of the squatters remarked, "we select the black
  members of the litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance of
  living." So that here we have artificial and natural selection working
  hand in hand. I may add that in the Tarentino the inhabitants keep black
  sheep alone, because the <i>Hypericum crispum</i> abounds there; and this
  plant does not injure black sheep, but kills the white ones in about a
  fortnight's time.<a name="NtA_540"
  href="#Nt_540"><sup>[540]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Complexion, and liability to certain diseases, are believed to run
  together in man and the lower animals. Thus white terriers suffer more
  than terriers of any other colour from the fatal Distemper.<a
  name="NtA_541" href="#Nt_541"><sup>[541]</sup></a> In North America
  plum-trees are liable to a disease which Downing<a name="NtA_542"
  href="#Nt_542"><sup>[542]</sup></a> believes is not caused by insects;
  the kinds bearing purple fruit are most affected, "and we have never
  known the green or yellow fruited varieties infected <!-- Page 228
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>{228}</span>until the
  other sorts had first become filled with the knots." On the other hand,
  peaches in North America suffer much from a disease called the
  <i>yellows</i>, which seems to be peculiar to that continent, and "more
  than nine-tenths of the victims, when the disease first appeared, were
  the yellow-fleshed peaches. The white-fleshed kinds are much more rarely
  attacked; in some parts of the country never." In Mauritius, the white
  sugar-canes have of late years been so severely attacked by a disease,
  that many planters have been compelled to give up growing this variety
  (although fresh plants were imported from China for trial), and cultivate
  only red canes.<a name="NtA_543" href="#Nt_543"><sup>[543]</sup></a> Now,
  if these plants had been forced to struggle with other competing plants
  and enemies, there cannot be a doubt that the colour of the flesh or skin
  of the fruit, unimportant as these characters are considered, would have
  rigorously determined their existence.</p>

  <p>Liability to the attacks of parasites is also connected with colour.
  It appears that white chickens are certainly more subject than
  dark-coloured chickens to the <i>gapes</i>, which is caused by a
  parasitic worm in the trachea.<a name="NtA_544"
  href="#Nt_544"><sup>[544]</sup></a> On the other hand, experience has
  shown that in France the caterpillars which produce white cocoons resist
  the deadly fungus better than those producing yellow cocoons.<a
  name="NtA_545" href="#Nt_545"><sup>[545]</sup></a> Analogous facts have
  been observed with plants: a new and beautiful white onion, imported from
  France, though planted close to other kinds, was alone attacked by a
  parasitic fungus.<a name="NtA_546" href="#Nt_546"><sup>[546]</sup></a>
  White verbenas are especially liable to mildew.<a name="NtA_547"
  href="#Nt_547"><sup>[547]</sup></a> Near Malaga, during an early period
  of the vine-disease, the green sorts suffered most; "and red and black
  grapes, even when interwoven with the sick plants, suffered not at all."
  In France whole groups of varieties were comparatively free, and others,
  such as the Chasselas, did not afford a single fortunate exception; but I
  do not know whether any correlation between colour and liability to
  disease was here observed.<a name="NtA_548"
  href="#Nt_548"><sup>[548]</sup></a> In a former chapter it was shown how
  curiously liable one variety of the strawberry is to mildew.</p>

<p><!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>{229}</span></p>

  <p>It is certain that insects regulate in many cases the range and even
  the existence of the higher animals, whilst living under their natural
  conditions. Under domestication light-coloured animals suffer most: in
  Thuringia<a name="NtA_549" href="#Nt_549"><sup>[549]</sup></a> the
  inhabitants do not like grey, white, or pale cattle, because they are
  much more troubled by various kinds of flies than the brown, red, or
  black cattle. An Albino negro, it has been remarked,<a name="NtA_550"
  href="#Nt_550"><sup>[550]</sup></a> was peculiarly sensitive to the bites
  of insects. In the West Indies<a name="NtA_551"
  href="#Nt_551"><sup>[551]</sup></a> it is said that "the only horned
  cattle fit for work are those which have a good deal of black in them.
  The white are terribly tormented by the insects; and they are weak and
  sluggish in proportion to the white."</p>

  <p>In Devonshire there is a prejudice against white pigs, because it is
  believed that the sun blisters them when turned out;<a name="NtA_552"
  href="#Nt_552"><sup>[552]</sup></a> and I knew a man who would not keep
  white pigs in Kent, for the same reason. The scorching of flowers by the
  sun seems likewise to depend much on colour; thus, dark pelargoniums
  suffer most; and from various accounts it is clear that the cloth-of-gold
  variety will not withstand a degree of exposure to sunshine which other
  varieties enjoy. Another amateur asserts that not only all dark-coloured
  verbenas, but likewise scarlets, suffer from the sun; "the paler kinds
  stand better, and pale blue is perhaps the best of all." So again with
  the heartsease (<i>Viola tricolor</i>); hot weather suits the blotched
  sorts, whilst it destroys the beautiful markings of some other kinds.<a
  name="NtA_553" href="#Nt_553"><sup>[553]</sup></a> During one extremely
  cold season in Holland all red-flowered hyacinths were observed to be
  very inferior in quality. It is believed by many agriculturists that red
  wheat is hardier in northern climates than white wheat.<a name="NtA_554"
  href="#Nt_554"><sup>[554]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With animals, white varieties from being conspicuous are the most
  liable to be attacked by beasts and birds of prey. In parts of France and
  Germany where hawks abound, persons are advised not to keep white
  pigeons; for, as Parmentier says, "it <!-- Page 230 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>{230}</span>is certain that in a
  flock the white always first fall victims to the kite." In Belgium, where
  so many societies have been established for the flight of
  carrier-pigeons, white is the one colour which for the same reason is
  disliked.<a name="NtA_555" href="#Nt_555"><sup>[555]</sup></a> On the
  other hand, it is said that the sea-eagle (<i>Falco ossifragus</i>,
  Linn.) on the west coast of Ireland picks out the black fowls, so that
  "the villagers avoid as much as possible rearing birds of that colour."
  M. Daudin,<a name="NtA_556" href="#Nt_556"><sup>[556]</sup></a> speaking
  of white rabbits kept in warrens in Russia, remarks that their colour is
  a great disadvantage, as they are thus more exposed to attack, and can be
  seen during bright nights from a distance. A gentleman in Kent, who
  failed to stock his woods with a nearly white and hardy kind of rabbit,
  accounted in the same manner for their early disappearance. Any one who
  will watch a white cat prowling after her prey will soon perceive under
  what a disadvantage she lies.</p>

  <p>The white Tartarian cherry, "owing either to its colour being so much
  like that of the leaves, or to the fruit always appearing from a distance
  unripe," is not so readily attacked by birds as other sorts. The
  yellow-fruited raspberry, which generally comes nearly true by seed, "is
  very little molested by birds, who evidently are not fond of it; so that
  nets may be dispensed with in places where nothing else will protect the
  red fruit."<a name="NtA_557" href="#Nt_557"><sup>[557]</sup></a> This
  immunity, though a benefit to the gardener, would be a disadvantage in a
  state of nature both to the cherry and raspberry, as their dissemination
  depends on birds. I noticed during several winters that some trees of the
  yellow-berried holly, which were raised from seed from a wild tree found
  by my father, remained covered with fruit, whilst not a scarlet berry
  could be seen on the adjoining trees of the common kind. A friend informs
  me that a mountain-ash (<i>Pyrus aucuparia</i>) growing in his garden
  bears berries which, though not differently coloured, are always devoured
  by birds before those on the other trees. This variety of the
  mountain-ash would thus be more freely disseminated, and the
  yellow-berried variety of the holly less freely, than the common
  varieties of these two trees.</p>

<p><!-- Page 231 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>{231}</span></p>

  <p>Independently of colour, other trifling differences are sometimes
  found to be of importance to plants under cultivation, and would be of
  paramount importance if they had to fight their own battle and to
  struggle with many competitors. The thin-shelled peas, called <i>pois
  sans parchemin</i>, are attacked by birds<a name="NtA_558"
  href="#Nt_558"><sup>[558]</sup></a> much more than common peas. On the
  other hand, the purple-podded pea, which has a hard shell, escaped the
  attacks of tomtits (<i>Parus major</i>) in my garden far better than any
  other kind. The thin-shelled walnut likewise suffers greatly from the
  tomtit.<a name="NtA_559" href="#Nt_559"><sup>[559]</sup></a> These same
  birds have been observed to pass over and thus favour the filbert,
  destroying only the other kinds of nuts which grew in the same orchard.<a
  name="NtA_560" href="#Nt_560"><sup>[560]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Certain varieties of the pear have soft bark, and these suffer
  severely from boring wood-beetles; whilst other varieties are known to
  resist their attacks much better.<a name="NtA_561"
  href="#Nt_561"><sup>[561]</sup></a> In North America the smoothness, or
  absence of down on the fruit, makes a great difference in the attacks of
  the weevil, "which is the uncompromising foe of all smooth stone-fruits;"
  and the cultivator "has the frequent mortification of seeing nearly all,
  or indeed often the whole crop, fall from the trees when half or
  two-thirds grown." Hence the nectarine suffers more than the peach. A
  particular variety of the Morello cherry, raised in North America, is
  without any assignable cause more liable to be injured by this same
  insect than other cherry-trees.<a name="NtA_562"
  href="#Nt_562"><sup>[562]</sup></a> From some unknown cause, the Winter
  Majetin apple enjoys the great advantage of not being infested by the
  coccus. On the other hand, a particular case has been recorded in which
  aphides confined themselves to the Winter Nelis pear, and touched no
  other kind in an extensive orchard.<a name="NtA_563"
  href="#Nt_563"><sup>[563]</sup></a> The existence of minute glands on the
  leaves of peaches, nectarines, and apricots, would not be esteemed by
  botanists as a character of the least importance, for they are present or
  absent in closely related sub-varieties, descended from the same
  parent-tree; yet there is good evidence<a name="NtA_564"
  href="#Nt_564"><sup>[564]</sup></a> that the <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>{232}</span>absence of glands leads
  to mildew, which is highly injurious to these trees.</p>

  <p>A difference either in flavour or in the amount of nutriment in
  certain varieties causes them to be more eagerly attacked by various
  enemies than other varieties of the same species. Bullfinches
  (<i>Pyrrhula vulgaris</i>) injure our fruit-trees by devouring the
  flower-buds, and a pair of these birds have been seen "to denude a large
  plum-tree in a couple of days of almost every bud;" but certain
  varieties<a name="NtA_565" href="#Nt_565"><sup>[565]</sup></a> of the
  apple and thorn (<i>Cratægus <span class="correction" title="Original reads `oxycantha', corrected by errata, page viii."
  >oxyacantha</span></i>) are more especially liable to be attacked. A
  striking instance of this was observed in Mr. Rivers's garden, in which
  two rows of a particular variety of plum<a name="NtA_566"
  href="#Nt_566"><sup>[566]</sup></a> had to be carefully protected, as
  they were usually stripped of all their buds during the winter, whilst
  other sorts growing near them escaped. The root (or enlarged stem) of
  Laing's Swedish turnip is preferred by hares, and therefore suffers more
  than other varieties. Hares and rabbits eat down common rye before St.
  John's-day-rye, when both grow together.<a name="NtA_567"
  href="#Nt_567"><sup>[567]</sup></a> In the South of France, when an
  orchard of almond-trees is formed, the nuts of the bitter variety are
  sown, "in order that they may not be devoured by field-mice;"<a
  name="NtA_568" href="#Nt_568"><sup>[568]</sup></a> so we see the use of
  the bitter principle in almonds.</p>

  <p>Other slight differences, which would be thought quite unimportant,
  are no doubt sometimes of great service both to plants and animals. The
  Whitesmith's gooseberry, as formerly stated, produces its leaves later
  than other varieties, and, as the flowers are thus left unprotected, the
  fruit often fails. In one variety of the cherry, according to Mr.
  Rivers,<a name="NtA_569" href="#Nt_569"><sup>[569]</sup></a> the petals
  are much curled backwards, and in consequence of this the stigmas were
  observed to be killed by a severe frost; whilst at the same time, in
  another variety with incurved petals, the stigmas were not in the least
  injured. The straw of the Fenton wheat is remarkably unequal in height;
  and a competent observer believes that this variety is highly productive,
  partly because the ears, from being distributed at various heights above
  the ground, <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page233"></a>{233}</span>are less crowded together. The same
  observer maintains that in the upright varieties the divergent awns are
  serviceable by breaking the shocks when the ears are dashed together by
  the wind.<a name="NtA_570" href="#Nt_570"><sup>[570]</sup></a> If several
  varieties of a plant are grown together, and the seed is indiscriminately
  harvested, it is clear that the hardier and more productive kinds will,
  by a sort of natural selection, gradually prevail over the others; this
  takes place, as Colonel Le Couteur believes,<a name="NtA_571"
  href="#Nt_571"><sup>[571]</sup></a> in our wheat-fields, for, as formerly
  shown, no variety is quite uniform in character. The same thing, as I am
  assured by nurserymen, would take place in our flower-gardens, if the
  seed of the different varieties were not separately saved. When the eggs
  of the wild and tame duck are hatched together, the young wild ducks
  almost invariably perish, from being of smaller size and not getting
  their fair share of food.<a name="NtA_572"
  href="#Nt_572"><sup>[572]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Facts in sufficient number have now been given showing that natural
  selection often checks, but occasionally favours, man's power of
  selection. These facts teach us, in addition, a valuable lesson, namely,
  that we ought to be extremely cautious in judging what characters are of
  importance in a state of nature to animals and plants, which have to
  struggle from the hour of their birth to that of their death for
  existence,&mdash;their existence depending on conditions, about which we
  are profoundly ignorant.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Circumstances favourable to Selection by Man.</i></p>

  <p>The possibility of selection rests on variability, and this, as we
  shall see in the following chapters, mainly depends on changed conditions
  of life, but is governed by infinitely complex, and, to a great extent,
  unknown laws. Domestication, even when long continued, occasionally
  causes but a small amount of variability, as in the case of the goose and
  turkey. The slight differences, however, which characterise each
  individual animal and plant would in most, probably in all cases, suffice
  for the production of distinct races through careful and prolonged
  selection. We see what selection, though acting on mere individual
  differences, can effect when families of cattle, sheep, <!-- Page 234
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>{234}</span>pigeons,
  &amp;c., of the same race, have been separately bred during a number of
  years by different men without any wish on their part to modify the
  breed. We see the same fact in the difference between hounds bred for
  hunting in different districts,<a name="NtA_573"
  href="#Nt_573"><sup>[573]</sup></a> and in many other such cases.</p>

  <p>In order that selection should produce any result, it is manifest that
  the crossing of distinct races must be prevented; hence facility in
  pairing, as with the pigeon, is highly favourable for the work; and
  difficulty in pairing, as with cats, prevents the formation of distinct
  breeds. On nearly the same principle the cattle of the small island of
  Jersey have been improved in their milking qualities "with a rapidity
  that could not have been obtained in a widely extended country like
  France."<a name="NtA_574" href="#Nt_574"><sup>[574]</sup></a> Although
  free crossing is a danger on the one side which every one can see, too
  close interbreeding is a hidden danger on the other side. Unfavourable
  conditions of life overrule the power of selection. Our improved heavy
  breeds of cattle and sheep could not have been formed on mountainous
  pastures; nor could dray-horses have been raised on a barren and
  inhospitable land, such as the Falkland islands, where even the light
  horses of La Plata rapidly decrease in size. Nor could the wool of sheep
  have been much increased in length within the Tropics; yet selection has
  kept Merino sheep nearly true under diversified and unfavourable
  conditions of life. The power of selection is so great, that breeds of
  the dog, sheep, and poultry, of the largest and least size, long and
  short beaked pigeons, and other breeds with opposite characters, have had
  their characteristic qualities augmented, though treated in every way
  alike, being exposed to the same climate and fed on the same food.
  Selection, however, is either checked or favoured by the effects of use
  or habit. Our wonderfully-improved pigs could never have been formed if
  they had been forced to search for their own food; the English racehorse
  and greyhound could not have been improved up to their present high
  standard of excellence without constant training.</p>

  <p>As conspicuous deviations of structure occur rarely, the improvement
  of each breed is generally the result, as already <!-- Page 235 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>{235}</span>remarked, of the
  selection of slight individual differences. Hence the closest attention,
  the sharpest powers of observation, and indomitable perseverance, are
  indispensable. It is, also, highly important that many individuals of the
  breed which is to be improved should be raised; for thus there will be a
  better chance of the appearance of variations in the right direction, and
  individuals varying in an unfavourable manner may be freely rejected or
  destroyed. But that a large number of individuals should be raised, it is
  necessary that the conditions of life should favour the propagation of
  the species. Had the peacock been bred as easily as the fowl, we should
  probably ere this have had many distinct races. We see the importance of
  a large number of plants, from the fact of nursery gardeners almost
  always beating amateurs in the exhibition of new varieties. In 1845 it
  was estimated<a name="NtA_575" href="#Nt_575"><sup>[575]</sup></a> that
  between 4000 and 5000 pelargoniums were annually raised from seed in
  England, yet a decidedly improved variety is rarely obtained. At Messrs.
  Carter's grounds, in Essex, where such flowers as the Lobelia, Nemophila,
  Mignonette, &amp;c., are grown by the acre for seed, "scarcely a season
  passes without some new kinds being raised, or some improvement affected
  on old kinds."<a name="NtA_576" href="#Nt_576"><sup>[576]</sup></a> At
  Kew, as Mr. Beaton remarks, where many seedlings of common plants are
  raised, "you see new forms of Laburnums, Spiræas, and other shrubs."<a
  name="NtA_577" href="#Nt_577"><sup>[577]</sup></a> So with animals:
  Marshall,<a name="NtA_578" href="#Nt_578"><sup>[578]</sup></a> in
  speaking of the sheep in one part of Yorkshire, remarks, "as they belong
  to poor people, and are mostly in small lots, they never can be
  improved." Lord Rivers, when asked how he succeeded in always having
  first-rate greyhounds, answered, "I breed many, and hang many." This, as
  another man remarks, "was the secret of his success; and the same will be
  found in exhibiting fowls,&mdash;successful competitors breed largely,
  and keep the best."<a name="NtA_579"
  href="#Nt_579"><sup>[579]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It follows from this that the capacity of breeding at an early age and
  at short successive intervals, as with pigeons, rabbits, &amp;c.,
  facilitates selection; for the result is thus soon made visible, and
  perseverance in the work is encouraged. It can hardly be <!-- Page 236
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>{236}</span>accidental
  that the great majority of the culinary and agricultural plants which
  have yielded numerous races are annuals or biennials, which therefore are
  capable of rapid propagation and thus of improvement. Sea-kale,
  asparagus, common and Jerusalem artichokes, potatoes, and onions, alone
  are perennials. Onions are propagated like annuals, and of the other
  plants just specified, none, with the exception of the potato, have
  yielded more than one or two varieties. No doubt fruit-trees, which
  cannot be propagated quickly by seed, have yielded a host of varieties,
  though not permanent races; but these, judging from pre-historic remains,
  were produced at a later and more civilised epoch than the races of
  culinary and agricultural plants.</p>

  <p>A species may be highly variable, but distinct races will not be
  formed, if from any cause selection be not applied. The carp is highly
  variable, but it would be extremely difficult to select slight variations
  in fishes whilst living in their natural state, and distinct races have
  not been formed;<a name="NtA_580" href="#Nt_580"><sup>[580]</sup></a> on
  the other hand, a closely allied species, the gold-fish, from being
  reared in glass or open vessels, and from having been carefully attended
  to by the Chinese, has yielded many races. Neither the bee, which has
  been semi-domesticated from an extremely remote period, nor the cochineal
  insect, which was cultivated by the aboriginal Mexicans, has yielded
  races; and it would be impossible to match the queen-bee with any
  particular drone, and most difficult to match cochineal insects.
  Silk-moths, on the other hand, have been subjected to rigorous selection,
  and have produced a host of races. Cats, which from their nocturnal
  habits cannot be selected for breeding, do not, as formerly remarked,
  yield distinct races in the same country. The ass in England varies much
  in colour and size; but it is an animal of little value, bred by poor
  people; consequently there has been no selection, and distinct races have
  not been formed. We must not attribute the inferiority of our asses to
  climate, for in India they are of even smaller size than in Europe. But
  when selection is brought to bear on the ass, all is changed. Near
  Cordova, as I am informed (Feb. 1860) by Mr. W.&nbsp;E. Webb, C.E., they are
  carefully bred, as much as 200<i>l.</i> having been paid for a stallion
  ass, <!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page237"></a>{237}</span>and they have been immensely improved. In
  Kentucky, asses have been imported (for breeding mules) from Spain,
  Malta, and France; these "seldom averaged more than fourteen hands high;
  but the Kentuckians, by great care, have raised them up to fifteen hands,
  and sometimes even to sixteen. The prices paid for these splendid
  animals, for such they really are, will prove how much they are in
  request. One male, of great celebrity, was sold for upwards of one
  thousand pounds sterling." These choice asses are sent to cattle-shows,
  one day being given to their exhibition.<a name="NtA_581"
  href="#Nt_581"><sup>[581]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Analogous facts have been observed with plants: the nutmeg-tree in the
  Malay archipelago is highly variable, but there has been no selection,
  and there are no distinct races.<a name="NtA_582"
  href="#Nt_582"><sup>[582]</sup></a> The common mignonette (<i>Reseda
  odorata</i>), from bearing inconspicuous flowers, valued solely for their
  fragrance, "remains in the same unimproved condition as when first
  introduced."<a name="NtA_583" href="#Nt_583"><sup>[583]</sup></a> Our
  common forest-trees are very variable, as may be seen in every extensive
  nursery-ground; but as they are not valued like fruit-trees, and as they
  seed late in life, no selection has been applied to them; consequently,
  as Mr. Patrick Matthews remarks,<a name="NtA_584"
  href="#Nt_584"><sup>[584]</sup></a> they have not yielded distinct races,
  leafing at different periods, growing to different sizes, and producing
  timber fit for different purposes. We have gained only some fanciful and
  semi-monstrous varieties, which no doubt appeared suddenly as we now see
  them.</p>

  <p>Some botanists have argued that plants cannot have so strong a
  tendency to vary as is generally supposed, because many species long
  grown in botanic gardens, or unintentionally cultivated year after year
  mingled with our corn crops, have not produced distinct races; but this
  is accounted for by slight variations not having been selected and
  propagated. Let a plant which is now grown in a botanic garden, or any
  common weed, be cultivated on a large scale, and let a sharp-sighted
  gardener look out for each slight variety and sow the seed, and then, if
  distinct races are not produced, the argument will be valid.</p>

<p><!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>{238}</span></p>

  <p>The importance of selection is likewise shown by considering special
  characters. For instance, with most breeds of fowls the form of the comb
  and the colour of the plumage have been attended to, and are eminently
  characteristic of each race; but in Dorkings, fashion has never demanded
  uniformity of comb or colour; and the utmost diversity in these respects
  prevails. Rose-combs, double-combs, cup-combs, &amp;c., and colours of
  all kinds, may be seen in purely-bred and closely related Dorking fowls,
  whilst other points, such as the general form of body, and the presence
  of an additional toe, have been attended to, and are invariably present.
  It has also been ascertained that colour can be fixed in this breed, as
  well as in any other.<a name="NtA_585"
  href="#Nt_585"><sup>[585]</sup></a></p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>During the formation or improvement of a breed, its members will
  always be found to vary much in those characters to which especial
  attention is directed, and of which each slight improvement is eagerly
  sought and selected. Thus with short-faced tumbler-pigeons, the shortness
  of the beak, shape of head and plumage,&mdash;with carriers, the length
  of the beak and wattle,&mdash;with fantails, the tail and
  carriage,&mdash;with Spanish fowls, the white face and comb,&mdash;with
  long-eared rabbits, the length of ear, are all points which are eminently
  variable. So it is in every case, and the large price paid for first-rate
  animals proves the difficulty of breeding them up to the highest standard
  of excellence. This subject has been discussed by fanciers,<a
  name="NtA_586" href="#Nt_586"><sup>[586]</sup></a> and the greater prizes
  given for highly improved breeds, in comparison with those given for old
  breeds which are not now undergoing rapid improvement, has been fully
  justified. Nathusius makes<a name="NtA_587"
  href="#Nt_587"><sup>[587]</sup></a> a similar remark when discussing the
  less uniform character of improved Shorthorn cattle and of the English
  horse, in comparison, for example, with the unennobled cattle of Hungary,
  or with the horses of the Asiatic steppes. This want of uniformity in the
  parts which at the time are undergoing selection, chiefly depends on the
  strength of the principle of reversion but it likewise depends to a
  certain extent on the continued <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page239"></a>{239}</span>variability of the parts which have
  recently varied. That the same parts do continue varying in the same
  manner we must admit, for, if it were not so, there could be no
  improvement beyond an early standard of excellence, and we know that such
  improvement is not only possible, but is of general occurrence.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of continued variability, and more especially of
  reversion, all highly improved races, if neglected or not subjected to
  incessant selection, soon degenerate. Youatt gives a curious instance of
  this in some cattle formerly kept in Glamorganshire; but in this case the
  cattle were not fed with sufficient care. Mr. Baker, in his memoir on the
  Horse, sums up: "It must have been observed in the preceding pages that,
  whenever there has been neglect, the breed has proportionally
  deteriorated."<a name="NtA_588" href="#Nt_588"><sup>[588]</sup></a> If a
  considerable number of improved cattle, sheep, or other animals of the
  same race, were allowed to breed freely together, with no selection, but
  with no change in their condition of life, there can be no doubt that
  after a score or hundred generations they would be very far from
  excellent of their kind; but, from what we see of the many common races
  of dogs, cattle, fowls, pigeons, &amp;c., which without any particular
  care have long retained nearly the same character, we have no grounds for
  believing that they would altogether depart from their type.</p>

  <p>It is a general belief amongst breeders that characters of all kinds
  become fixed by long-continued inheritance. But I have attempted to show
  in the fourteenth chapter that this belief apparently resolves itself
  into the following proposition, namely, that all characters whatever,
  whether recently acquired or ancient, tend to be transmitted, but that
  those which have already long withstood all counteracting influences,
  will, as a general rule, continue to withstand them, and consequently be
  faithfully transmitted.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Tendency in Man to carry the practice of Selection to an extreme
point.</i></p>

  <p>It is an important principle that in the process of selection man
  almost invariably wishes to go to an extreme point. Thus, in useful
  qualities, there is no limit to his desire to breed certain <!-- Page 240
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>{240}</span>horses and
  dogs as fleet as possible, and others as strong as possible; certain
  kinds of sheep for extreme fineness, and others for extreme length of
  wool; and he wishes to produce fruit, grain, tubers, and other useful
  parts of plants, as large and excellent as possible. With animals bred
  for amusement, the same principle is even more powerful; for fashion, as
  we see even in our dress, always runs to extremes. This view has been
  expressly admitted by fanciers. Instances were given in the chapters on
  the pigeon, but here is another: Mr. Eaton, after describing a
  comparatively new variety, namely, the Archangel, remarks, "What fanciers
  intend doing with this bird I am at a loss to know, whether they intend
  to breed it down to the tumbler's head and beak, or carry it out to the
  carrier's head and beak; leaving it as they found it, is not
  progressing." Ferguson, speaking of fowls, says, "their peculiarities,
  whatever they may be, must necessarily be fully developed: a little
  peculiarity forms nought but ugliness, seeing it violates the existing
  laws of symmetry." So Mr. Brent, in discussing the merits of the
  sub-varieties of the Belgian canary-bird, remarks, "Fanciers always go to
  extremes; they do not admire indefinite properties."<a name="NtA_589"
  href="#Nt_589"><sup>[589]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This principle, which necessarily leads to divergence of character,
  explains the present state of various domestic races. We can thus see how
  it is that race-horses and dray-horses, greyhounds and mastiffs, which
  are opposed to each other in every character,&mdash;how varieties so
  distinct as Cochin-China fowls and bantams, or carrier-pigeons with very
  long beaks, and tumblers with excessively short beaks, have been derived
  from the same stock. As each breed is slowly improved, the inferior
  varieties are first neglected and finally lost. In a few cases, by the
  aid of old records, or from intermediate varieties still existing in
  countries where other fashions have prevailed, we are enabled partially
  to trace the graduated changes through which certain breeds have passed.
  Selection, whether methodical or unconscious, always tending towards an
  extreme point, together with the neglect and slow extinction of the
  intermediate and less-valued forms, is the key which unlocks the mystery
  how man has produced such wonderful results.</p>

<p><!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241"></a>{241}</span></p>

  <p>In a few instances selection, guided by utility for a single purpose,
  has led to convergence of character. All the improved and different races
  of the pig, as Nathusius has well shown,<a name="NtA_590"
  href="#Nt_590"><sup>[590]</sup></a> closely approach each other in
  character, in their shortened legs and muzzles, their almost hairless,
  large, rounded bodies, and small tusks. We see some degree of convergence
  in the similar outline of the body in well-bred cattle belonging to
  distinct races.<a name="NtA_591" href="#Nt_591"><sup>[591]</sup></a> I
  know of no other such cases.</p>

  <p>Continued divergence of character depends on, and is indeed a clear
  proof, as previously remarked, of the same parts continuing to vary in
  the same direction. The tendency to mere general variability or
  plasticity of organisation can certainly be inherited, even from one
  parent, as has been shown by Gärtner and Kölreuter, in the production of
  varying hybrids from two species, of which one alone was variable. It is
  in itself probable that, when an organ has varied in any manner, it will
  again vary in the same manner, if the conditions which first caused the
  being to vary remain, as far as can be judged, the same. This is either
  tacitly or expressly admitted by all horticulturists: if a gardener
  observes one or two additional petals in a flower, he feels confident
  that in a few generations he will be able to raise a double flower,
  crowded with petals. Some of the seedlings from the weeping Moccas oak
  were so prostrate that they only crawled along the ground. A seedling
  from the fastigate or upright Irish yew is described as differing greatly
  from the parent-form "by the exaggeration of the fastigate habit of its
  branches."<a name="NtA_592" href="#Nt_592"><sup>[592]</sup></a> Mr.
  Sheriff, who has been more successful than any other man in raising new
  kinds of wheat, remarks, "A good variety may safely be regarded as the
  forerunner of a better one."<a name="NtA_593"
  href="#Nt_593"><sup>[593]</sup></a> A great rose-grower, Mr. Rivers, has
  made the same remark with respect to roses. Sageret,<a name="NtA_594"
  href="#Nt_594"><sup>[594]</sup></a> who had large experience, in speaking
  of the future progress of fruit-trees, observes that the most important
  principle is "that the more plants have departed from their original
  type, the more they tend to depart from it." There is apparently much
  truth in this <!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page242"></a>{242}</span>remark; for we can in no other way
  understand the surprising amount of difference between varieties in the
  parts or qualities which are valued, whilst other parts retain nearly
  their original character.</p>

  <p>The foregoing discussion naturally leads to the question, what is the
  limit to the possible amount of variation in any part or quality, and,
  consequently, is there any limit to what selection can effect? Will a
  race-horse ever be reared fleeter than Eclipse? Can our prize-cattle and
  sheep be still further improved? Will a gooseberry ever weigh more than
  that produced by "London" in 1852? Will the beet-root in France yield a
  greater percentage of sugar? Will future varieties of wheat and other
  grain produce heavier crops than our present varieties? These questions
  cannot be positively answered; but it is certain that we ought to be
  cautious in answering by a negative. In some lines of variation the limit
  has probably been reached. Youatt believes that the reduction of bone in
  some of our sheep has already been carried so far that it entails great
  delicacy of constitution.<a name="NtA_595"
  href="#Nt_595"><sup>[595]</sup></a> But seeing the great improvement
  within recent times in our cattle and sheep, and especially in our pigs;
  seeing the wonderful increase in weight in our poultry of all kinds
  during the last few years; he would be a bold man who would assert that
  perfection has been reached. Eclipse perhaps may never be beaten until
  all our race-horses have been rendered swifter, through the selection of
  the best horses during many generations; and then the old Eclipse may
  possibly be eclipsed; but, as Mr. Wallace has remarked, there must be an
  ultimate limit to the fleetness of every animal, whether under nature or
  domestication; and with the horse this limit has perhaps been reached.
  Until our fields are better manured, it may be impossible for a new
  variety of wheat to yield a heavier crop. But in many cases those who are
  best qualified to judge do not believe that the extreme point has as yet
  been reached even with respect to characters which have already been
  carried to a high standard of perfection. For instance, the short-faced
  tumbler-pigeon has been greatly modified; nevertheless, according to Mr.
  Eaton,<a name="NtA_596" href="#Nt_596"><sup>[596]</sup></a> "the field is
  still as open for fresh competitors as it was one hundred years ago."
  Over and over again it has been said that <!-- Page 243 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>{243}</span>perfection had been
  attained with our flowers, but a higher standard has soon been reached.
  Hardly any fruit has been more improved than the strawberry, yet a great
  authority remarks,<a name="NtA_597" href="#Nt_597"><sup>[597]</sup></a>
  "it must not be concealed that we are far from the extreme limits at
  which we may arrive."</p>

  <p>Time is an important element in the formation of our domestic races,
  as it <span class="correction" title="Original reads `permitts'."
  >permits</span> innumerable individuals to be born, and these when
  exposed to diversified conditions are rendered variable. Methodical
  selection has been occasionally practised from an ancient period to the
  present day, even by semi-civilised people, and during former times will
  have produced some effect. Unconscious selection will have been still
  more effective; for during a lengthened period the more valuable
  individual animals will occasionally have been saved, and the less
  valuable neglected. In the course, also, of time, different varieties,
  especially in the less civilised countries, will have been more or less
  modified through natural selection. It is generally believed, though on
  this head we have little or no evidence, that new characters in time
  become fixed; and after having long remained fixed it seems possible that
  under new conditions they might again be rendered variable.</p>

  <p>How great the lapse of time has been since man first domesticated
  animals and cultivated plants, we begin dimly to see. When the
  lake-buildings of Switzerland were inhabited during the Neolithic period,
  several animals were already domesticated and various plants cultivated.
  If we may judge from what we now see of the habits of savages, it is
  probable that the men of the earlier Stone period&mdash;when many great
  quadrupeds were living which are now extinct, and when the face of the
  country was widely different from what it now is&mdash;possessed at least
  some few domesticated animals, although their remains have not as yet
  been discovered. If the science of language can be trusted, the art of
  ploughing and sowing the land was followed, and the chief animals had
  been already domesticated, at an epoch so immensely remote, that the
  Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Gothic, Celtic, and Sclavonic languages had not
  as yet diverged from their common parent-tongue.<a name="NtA_598"
  href="#Nt_598"><sup>[598]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>{244}</span></p>

  <p>It is scarcely possible to overrate the effects of selection
  occasionally carried on in various ways and places during thousands of
  generations. All that we know, and, in a still stronger degree, all that
  we do not know,<a name="NtA_599" href="#Nt_599"><sup>[599]</sup></a> of
  the history of the great majority of our breeds, even of our more modern
  breeds, agrees with the view that their production, through the action of
  unconscious and methodical selection, has been almost insensibly slow.
  When a man attends rather more closely than is usual to the breeding of
  his animals, he is almost sure to improve them to a slight extent. They
  are in consequence valued in his immediate neighbourhood, and are bred by
  others; and their characteristic features, whatever these may be, will
  then slowly but steadily be increased, sometimes by methodical and almost
  always by unconscious selection. At last a strain, deserving to be called
  a sub-variety, becomes a little more widely known, receives a local name,
  and spreads. The spreading will have been extremely slow during ancient
  and less civilised times, but now is rapid. By the time that the new
  breed had assumed a somewhat distinct character, its history, hardly
  noticed at the time, will have been completely forgotten; for, as Low
  remarks,<a name="NtA_600" href="#Nt_600"><sup>[600]</sup></a> "we know
  how quickly the memory of such events is effaced."</p>

  <p>As soon as a new breed is thus formed, it is liable through the same
  process to break up into new strains and sub-varieties. For different
  varieties are suited for, and are valued under, different circumstances.
  Fashion changes, but, should a fashion last for even a moderate length of
  time, so strong is the principle of inheritance, that some effect will
  probably be impressed on the breed. Thus varieties go on increasing in
  number, and history shows us how wonderfully they have increased since
  the earliest records.<a name="NtA_601"
  href="#Nt_601"><sup>[601]</sup></a> As each new variety is produced, the
  earlier, intermediate, and less valuable forms will be neglected, and
  perish. When a breed, from not being valued, is kept in small numbers,
  its extinction almost inevitably follows sooner or later, either from
  accidental causes of destruction or from close interbreeding; and this is
  an event which, in the case of well-marked breeds, excites attention. The
  birth or production of a new domestic race is so slow a process that it
  <!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>{245}</span>escapes notice; its death or destruction
  is comparatively sudden, is often recorded, and when too late sometimes
  regretted.</p>

  <p>Several authors have drawn a wide distinction between artificial and
  natural races. The latter are more uniform in character, possessing in a
  high degree the character of natural species, and are of ancient origin.
  They are generally found in less civilised countries, and have probably
  been largely modified by natural selection, and only to a small extent by
  man's unconscious and methodical selection. They have, also, during a
  long period, been directly acted on by the physical conditions of the
  countries which they inhabit. The so-called artificial races, on the
  other hand, are not so uniform in character; some have a semi-monstrous
  character, such as "the wry-legged terriers so useful in
  rabbit-shooting,"<a name="NtA_602" href="#Nt_602"><sup>[602]</sup></a>
  turnspit dogs, ancon sheep, niata oxen, Polish fowls, fantail-pigeons,
  &amp;c.; their characteristic features have generally been acquired
  suddenly, though subsequently increased in many cases by careful
  selection. Other races, which certainly must be called artificial, for
  they have been largely modified by methodical selection and by crossing,
  as the English race-horse, terrier-dogs, the English game-cock, Antwerp
  carrier-pigeons, &amp;c., nevertheless cannot be said to have an
  unnatural appearance; and no distinct line, as it seems to me, can be
  drawn between natural and artificial races.</p>

  <p>It is not surprising that domestic races should generally present a
  different aspect from natural species. Man selects and propagates
  modifications solely for his own use or fancy, and not for the creature's
  own good. His attention is struck by strongly marked modifications, which
  have appeared suddenly, due to some great disturbing cause in the
  organisation. He attends almost exclusively to external characters; and
  when he succeeds in modifying internal organs,&mdash;when for instance he
  reduces the bones and offal, or loads the viscera with fat, or gives
  early maturity, &amp;c.,&mdash;the chances are strong that he will at the
  same time weaken the constitution. On the other hand, when an animal has
  to struggle throughout its life with many competitors and enemies, under
  circumstances inconceivably complex and liable to change, modifications
  of the most varied nature&mdash;in the internal organs as well as in
  external characters, in the <!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page246"></a>{246}</span>functions and mutual relations of
  parts&mdash;will be rigorously tested, preserved, or rejected. Natural
  selection often checks man's comparatively feeble and capricious attempts
  at improvement; and if this were not so, the result of his work, and of
  nature's work, would be even still more different. Nevertheless, we must
  not overrate the amount of difference between natural species and
  domestic races; the most experienced naturalists have often disputed
  whether the latter are descended from one or from several aboriginal
  stocks, and this clearly shows that there is no palpable difference
  between species and races.</p>

  <p>Domestic races propagate their kind far more truly, and endure for
  much longer periods, than most naturalists are willing to admit. Breeders
  feel no doubt on this head; ask a man who has long reared Shorthorn or
  Hereford cattle, Leicester or Southdown sheep, Spanish or Game poultry,
  tumbler or carrier-pigeons, whether these races may not have been derived
  from common progenitors, and he will probably laugh you to scorn. The
  breeder admits that he may hope to produce sheep with finer or longer
  wool and with better carcases, or handsomer fowls, or carrier-pigeons
  with beaks just perceptibly longer to the practised eye, and thus be
  successful at an exhibition. Thus far he will go, but no farther. He does
  not reflect on what follows from adding up during a long course of time
  many, slight, successive modifications; nor does he reflect on the former
  existence of numerous varieties, connecting the links in each divergent
  line of descent. He concludes, as was shown in the earlier chapters, that
  all the chief breeds to which he has long attended are aboriginal
  productions. The systematic naturalist, on the other hand, who generally
  knows nothing of the art of breeding, who does not pretend to know how
  and when the several domestic races were formed, who cannot have seen the
  intermediate gradations, for they do not now exist, nevertheless feels no
  doubt that these races are sprung from a single source. But ask him
  whether the closely allied natural species which he has studied may not
  have descended from a common progenitor, and he in his turn will perhaps
  reject the notion with scorn. Thus the naturalist and breeder may
  mutually learn a useful lesson from each other.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Summary on Selection by Man.</i>&mdash;There can be no doubt that
  <!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page247"></a>{247}</span>methodical selection has effected and will
  effect wonderful results. It was occasionally practised in ancient times,
  and is still practised by semi-civilised people. Characters of the
  highest importance, and others of trifling value, have been attended to,
  and modified. I need not here repeat what has been so often said on the
  part which unconscious selection has played: we see its power in the
  difference between flocks which have been separately bred, and in the
  slow changes, as circumstances have slowly changed, which many animals
  have undergone in the same country, or when transported into a foreign
  land. We see the combined effects of methodical and unconscious selection
  in the great amount of difference between varieties in those parts or
  qualities which are valued by man, in comparison with those which are not
  valued, and consequently have not been attended to. Natural selection
  often determines man's power of selection. We sometimes err in imagining
  that characters, which are considered as unimportant by the systematic
  naturalist, could not be affected by the struggle for existence, and
  therefore be acted on by natural selection; but striking cases have been
  given, showing how great an error this is.</p>

  <p>The possibility of selection coming into action rests on variability;
  and this is mainly caused, as we shall hereafter see, by changes in the
  conditions of life. Selection is sometimes rendered difficult, or even
  impossible, by the conditions being opposed to the desired character or
  quality. It is sometimes checked by the lessened fertility and weakened
  constitution which follow from long-continued close interbreeding. That
  methodical selection may be successful, the closest attention and
  discernment, combined with unwearied patience, are absolutely necessary;
  and these same qualities, though not indispensable, are highly
  serviceable in the case of unconscious selection. It is almost necessary
  that a large number of individuals should be reared; for thus there will
  be a fair chance of variations of the desired nature arising, and every
  individual with the slightest blemish or in any degree inferior may be
  freely rejected. Hence length of time is an important element of success.
  Thus, also, propagation at an early age and at short intervals favours
  the work. Facility in pairing animals, or their inhabiting a confined
  area, is advantageous as a check to free crossing. Whenever and <!-- Page
  248 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>{248}</span>wherever
  selection is not practised, distinct races are not formed. When any one
  part of the body or quality is not attended to, it remains either
  unchanged or varies in a fluctuating manner, whilst at the same time
  other parts and other qualities may become permanently and greatly
  modified. But from the tendency to reversion and to continued
  variability, those parts or organs which are now undergoing rapid
  improvement through selection, are likewise found to vary much.
  Consequently highly-bred animals, when neglected, soon degenerate; but we
  have no reason to believe that the effects of long-continued selection
  would, if the conditions of life remained the same, be soon and
  completely lost.</p>

  <p>Man always tends to go to an extreme point in the selection, whether
  methodical or unconscious, of all useful and pleasing qualities. This is
  an important principle, as it leads to continued divergence, and in some
  rare cases to convergence of character. The possibility of continued
  divergence rests on the tendency in each part or organ to go on varying
  in the same manner in which it has already varied; and that this occurs,
  is proved by the steady and gradual improvement of many animals and
  plants during lengthened periods. The principle of divergence of
  character, combined with the neglect and final extinction of all
  previous, less-valued, and intermediate varieties, explains the amount of
  difference and the distinctness of our several races. Although we may
  have reached the utmost limit to which certain characters can be
  modified, yet we are far from having reached, as we have good reason to
  believe, the limit in the majority of cases. Finally, from the difference
  between selection as carried on by man and by nature, we can understand
  how it is that domestic races often, though by no means always, differ in
  general aspect from closely allied natural species.</p>

  <p>Throughout this chapter and elsewhere I have spoken of selection as
  the paramount power, yet its action absolutely depends on what we in our
  ignorance call spontaneous or accidental variability. Let an architect be
  compelled to build an edifice with uncut stones, fallen from a precipice.
  The shape of each fragment may be called accidental; yet the shape of
  each has been determined by the force of gravity, the nature <!-- Page
  249 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span>of the
  rock, and the slope of the precipice,&mdash;events and circumstances, all
  of which depend on natural laws; but there is no relation between these
  laws and the purpose for which each fragment is used by the builder. In
  the same manner the variations of each creature are determined by fixed
  and immutable laws; but these bear no relation to the living structure
  which is slowly built up through the power of selection, whether this be
  natural or artificial selection.</p>

  <p>If our architect succeeded in rearing a noble edifice, using the rough
  wedge-shaped fragments for the arches, the longer stones for the lintels,
  and so forth, we should admire his skill even in a higher degree than if
  he had used stones shaped for the purpose. So it is with selection,
  whether applied by man or by nature; for though variability is
  indispensably necessary, yet, when we look at some highly complex and
  excellently adapted organism, variability sinks to a quite subordinate
  position in importance in comparison with selection, in the same manner
  as the shape of each fragment used by our supposed architect is
  unimportant in comparison with his skill.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We will now consider, as far as we can, the causes of the almost
  universal variability of our domesticated productions. The subject is an
  obscure one; but it may be useful to probe our ignorance. Some authors,
  for instance Dr. Prosper Lucas, look at variability as a necessary
  contingent on reproduction, and as much an aboriginal law, as growth or
  inheritance. Others have of late encouraged, perhaps unintentionally,
  this view by speaking of inheritance and variability as equal and
  antagonistic principles. Pallas maintained, and he has had some
  followers, that variability depends exclusively on the crossing of
  primordially distinct forms. Other authors attribute the tendency to
  variability to an excess of food, and with animals to an excess
  relatively to the amount of exercise taken, or again to the effects of a
  more genial climate. That these causes are all effective is highly
  probable. But we must, I think, take a broader view, and conclude that
  organic beings, when subjected during several generations to any change
  whatever in their conditions, tend to vary; the kind of variation which
  ensues depending in a far higher degree on the nature or constitution of
  the being, than on the nature of the changed conditions. <!-- Page 251
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>{251}</span></p>

  <p>Those authors who believe that it is a law of nature that each
  individual should differ in some slight degree from every other, may
  maintain, apparently with truth, that this is the fact, not only with all
  domesticated animals and cultivated plants, but likewise with all organic
  beings in a state of nature. The Laplander by long practice knows and
  gives a name to each reindeer, though, as Linnæus remarks, "to
  distinguish one from another among such multitudes was beyond my
  comprehension, for they were like ants on an ant-hill." In Germany
  shepherds have won wagers by recognising each sheep in a flock of a
  hundred, which they had never seen until the previous fortnight. This
  power of discrimination, however, is as nothing compared to that which
  some florists have acquired. Verlot mentions a gardener who could
  distinguish 150 kinds of camellia, when not in flower; and it has been
  positively asserted that the famous old Dutch florist Voorhelm, who kept
  above 1200 varieties of the hyacinth, was hardly ever deceived in knowing
  each variety by the bulb alone. Hence we must conclude that the bulbs of
  the hyacinth and the branches and leaves of the camellia, though
  appearing to an unpractised eye absolutely undistinguishable, yet really
  differ.<a name="NtA_603" href="#Nt_603"><sup>[603]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As Linnæus has compared the reindeer in number to ants, I may add that
  each ant knows its fellow of the same community. Several times I carried
  ants of the same species (<i>Formica rufa</i>) from one ant-hill to
  another, inhabited apparently by tens of thousands of ants; but the
  strangers were instantly detected and killed. I then put some ants taken
  from a very large nest into a bottle strongly perfumed with
  assaf&oelig;tida, and after an interval of twenty-four hours returned
  them to their home; they were at first threatened by their fellows, but
  were soon recognised and allowed to pass. Hence each ant certainly
  recognises, independently of odour, its fellow; and if all the ants of
  the same community have not some countersign or watchword, they must
  present to each other's senses some distinguishable character.</p>

<p><!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>{252}</span></p>

  <p>The dissimilarity of brothers or sisters of the same family, and of
  seedlings from the same capsule, may be in part accounted for by the
  unequal blending of the characters of the two parents, and by the more or
  less complete recovery through reversion of ancestral characters on
  either side; but we thus only push the difficulty further back in time,
  for what made the parents or their progenitors different? Hence the
  belief<a name="NtA_604" href="#Nt_604"><sup>[604]</sup></a> that an
  innate tendency to vary exists, independently of external conditions,
  seems at first sight probable. But even the seeds nurtured in the same
  capsule are not subjected to absolutely uniform conditions, as they draw
  their nourishment from different points; and we shall see in a future
  chapter that this difference sometimes suffices greatly to affect the
  character of the future plant. The less close similarity of the
  successive children of the same family in comparison with human twins,
  which often resemble each other in external appearance, mental
  disposition, and constitution, in so extraordinary a manner, apparently
  proves that the state of the parents at the exact period of conception,
  or the nature of the subsequent embryonic development, has a direct and
  powerful influence on the character of the offspring. Nevertheless, when
  we reflect on the <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page253"></a>{253}</span>individual differences between organic
  beings in a state of nature, as shown by every wild animal knowing its
  mate; and when we reflect on the infinite diversity of the many varieties
  of our domesticated productions, we may well be inclined to exclaim,
  though falsely as I believe, that Variability must be looked at as an
  ultimate fact, necessarily contingent on reproduction.</p>

  <p>Those authors who adopt this latter view would probably deny that each
  separate variation has its own proper exciting cause. Although we can
  seldom trace the precise relation between cause and effect, yet the
  considerations presently to be given lead to the conclusion that each
  modification must have its own distinct cause. When we hear of an infant
  born, for instance, with a crooked finger, a misplaced tooth, or other
  slight deviation of structure, it is difficult to bring the conviction
  home to the mind that such abnormal cases are the result of fixed laws,
  and not of what we blindly call accident. Under this point of view the
  following case, which has been carefully examined and communicated to me
  by Dr. William Ogle, is highly instructive. Two girls, born as twins, and
  in all respects extremely alike, had their little fingers on both hands
  crooked; and in both children the second bicuspid tooth in the upper jaw,
  of the second dentition, was misplaced; for these teeth, instead of
  standing in a line with the others, grew from the roof of the mouth
  behind the first bicuspids. Neither the parents nor any other member of
  the family had exhibited any similar peculiarity. Now, as both these
  children were affected in exactly the same manner by both deviations of
  structure, the idea of accident is at once excluded; and we are compelled
  to admit that there must have existed some precise and sufficient cause
  which, if it had occurred a hundred times, would have affected a hundred
  children.</p>

  <p>We will now consider the general arguments, which appear to me to have
  great weight, in favour of the view that variations of all kinds and
  degrees are directly or indirectly caused by the conditions of life to
  which each being, and more especially its ancestors, have been
  exposed.</p>

  <p>No one doubts that domesticated productions are more variable than
  organic beings which have never been removed from their <!-- Page 254
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>{254}</span>natural
  conditions. Monstrosities graduate so insensibly into mere variations
  that it is impossible to separate them; and all those who have studied
  monstrosities believe that they are far commoner with domesticated than
  with wild animals and plants;<a name="NtA_605"
  href="#Nt_605"><sup>[605]</sup></a> and in the case of plants,
  monstrosities would be equally noticeable in the natural as in the
  cultivated state. Under nature, the individuals of the same species are
  exposed to nearly uniform conditions, for they are rigorously kept to
  their proper places by a host of competing animals and plants; they have,
  also, long been habituated to their conditions of life; but it cannot be
  said that they are subject to quite uniform conditions, and they are
  liable to a certain amount of variation. The circumstances under which
  our domestic productions are reared are widely different: they are
  protected from competition; they have not only been removed from their
  natural conditions and often from their native land, but they are
  frequently carried from district to district, where they are treated
  differently, so that they never remain during a considerable length of
  time exposed to closely similar conditions. In conformity with this, all
  our domesticated productions, with the rarest exceptions, vary far more
  than natural species. The hive-bee, which feeds itself and follows in
  most respects its natural habits of life, is the least variable of all
  domesticated animals, and probably the goose is the next least variable;
  but even the goose varies more than almost any wild bird, so that it
  cannot be affiliated with perfect certainty to any natural species.
  Hardly a single plant can be named, which has long been cultivated and
  propagated by seed, that is not highly variable; common rye (<i>Secale
  cereale</i>) has afforded fewer and less marked varieties than almost any
  other cultivated plant;<a name="NtA_606"
  href="#Nt_606"><sup>[606]</sup></a> but it may be doubted whether the
  variations of this, the least valuable of all our cereals, have been
  closely observed.</p>

  <p>Bud-variation, which was fully discussed in a former chapter, shows us
  that variability may be quite independent of seminal reproduction, and
  likewise of reversion to long-lost ancestral characters. No one will
  maintain that the sudden appearance <!-- Page 255 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>{255}</span>of a moss-rose on a
  Provence-rose is a return to a former state, for mossiness of the calyx
  has been observed in no natural species; the same argument is applicable
  to variegated and laciniated leaves; nor can the appearance of nectarines
  on peach-trees be accounted for with any probability on the principle of
  reversion. But bud-variations more immediately concern us, as they occur
  far more frequently on plants which have been highly cultivated during a
  length of time, than on other and less highly cultivated plants; and very
  few well-marked instances have been observed with plants growing under
  strictly natural conditions. I have given one instance of an ash-tree
  growing in a gentleman's pleasure-grounds; and occasionally there may be
  seen, on beech and other trees, twigs leafing at a different period from
  the other branches. But our forest trees in England can hardly be
  considered as living under strictly natural conditions; the seedlings are
  raised and protected in nursery-grounds, and must often be transplanted
  into places where wild trees of the kind would not naturally grow. It
  would be esteemed a prodigy if a dog-rose growing in a hedge produced by
  bud-variation a moss-rose, or a wild bullace or wild cherry-tree yielded
  a branch bearing fruit of a different shape and colour from the ordinary
  fruit. The prodigy would be enhanced if these varying branches were found
  capable of propagation, not only by grafts, but sometimes by seed; yet
  analogous cases have occurred with many of our highly cultivated trees
  and herbs.</p>

  <p>These several considerations alone render it probable that variability
  of every kind is directly or indirectly caused by changed conditions of
  life. Or, to put the case under another point of view, if it were
  possible to expose all the individuals of a species during many
  generations to absolutely uniform conditions of life, there would be no
  variability.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>On the Nature of the Changes in the Conditions of Life which
induce Variability.</i></p>

  <p>From a remote period to the present day, under climates and
  circumstances as different as it is possible to conceive, organic beings
  of all kinds, when domesticated or cultivated, have <!-- Page 256
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>{256}</span>varied. We see
  this with the many domestic races of quadrupeds and birds belonging to
  different orders, with gold-fish and silkworms, with plants of many
  kinds, raised in various quarters of the world. In the deserts of
  northern Africa the date-palm has yielded thirty-eight varieties; in the
  fertile plains of India it is notorious how many varieties of rice and of
  a host of other plants exist; in a single Polynesian island, twenty-four
  varieties of the bread-fruit, the same number of the banana, and
  twenty-two varieties of the arum, are cultivated by the natives; the
  mulberry-tree in India and Europe has yielded many varieties serving as
  food for the silkworm; and in China sixty-three varieties of the bamboo
  are used for various domestic purposes.<a name="NtA_607"
  href="#Nt_607"><sup>[607]</sup></a> These facts alone, and innumerable
  others could be added, indicate that a change of almost any kind in the
  conditions of life suffices to cause variability&mdash;different changes
  acting on different organisms.</p>

  <p>Andrew Knight<a name="NtA_608" href="#Nt_608"><sup>[608]</sup></a>
  attributed the variation of both animals and plants to a more abundant
  supply of nourishment, or to a more favourable climate, than that natural
  to the species. A more genial climate, however, is far from necessary;
  the kidney-bean, which is often injured by our spring frosts, and
  peaches, which require the protection of a wall, have varied much in
  England, as has the orange-tree in northern Italy, where it is barely
  able to exist.<a name="NtA_609" href="#Nt_609"><sup>[609]</sup></a> Nor
  can we overlook the fact, though not immediately connected with our
  present subject, that the plants and shells of the arctic regions are
  eminently variable.<a name="NtA_610" href="#Nt_610"><sup>[610]</sup></a>
  Moreover, it does not appear that a change of climate, whether more or
  less genial, is one of the most potent causes of variability; for in
  regard to plants Alph. De Candolle, in his 'Géographie <!-- Page 257
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>{257}</span>Botanique,'
  repeatedly shows that the native country of a plant, where in most cases
  it has been longest cultivated, is that where it has yielded the greatest
  number of varieties.</p>

  <p>It is doubtful whether a change in the nature of the food is a potent
  cause of variability. Scarcely any domesticated animal has varied more
  than the pigeon or the fowl, but their food, especially that of
  highly-bred pigeons, is generally the same. Nor can our cattle and sheep
  have been subjected to any great change in this respect. But in all these
  cases the food probably is much less varied in kind than that which was
  consumed by the species in its natural state.<a name="NtA_611"
  href="#Nt_611"><sup>[611]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of all the causes which induce variability, excess of food, whether or
  not changed in nature, is probably the most powerful. This view was held
  with regard to plants by Andrew Knight, and is now held by Schleiden,
  more especially in reference to the inorganic elements of the food.<a
  name="NtA_612" href="#Nt_612"><sup>[612]</sup></a> In order to give a
  plant more food it suffices in most cases to grow it separately, and thus
  prevent other plants robbing its roots. It is surprising, as I have often
  seen, how vigorously our common wild plants flourish when planted by
  themselves, though not in highly manured land. Growing plants separately
  is, in fact, the first step in cultivation. We see the converse of the
  belief that excess of food induces variability in the following statement
  by a great raiser of seeds of all kinds.<a name="NtA_613"
  href="#Nt_613"><sup>[613]</sup></a> "It is a rule invariably with us,
  when we desire to keep a true stock of any one kind of seed, to grow it
  on poor land without dung; but when we grow for quantity, we act
  contrary, and sometimes have dearly to repent of it."</p>

  <p>In the case of animals the want of a proper amount of exercise, as
  Bechstein has remarked, has perhaps played, independently of the direct
  effects of the disuse of any particular organ, an important part in
  causing variability. We can see in a vague manner that, when the
  organised and nutrient fluids of the body are not used during growth, or
  by the wear and tear of the tissues, <!-- Page 258 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>{258}</span>they will be in excess;
  and as growth, nutrition, and reproduction are intimately allied
  processes, this superfluity might disturb the due and proper action of
  the reproductive organs, and consequently affect the character of the
  future offspring. But it may be argued that neither an excess of food nor
  a superfluity in the organised fluids of the body necessarily induces
  variability. The goose and the turkey have been well fed for many
  generations, yet have varied very little. Our fruit-trees and culinary
  plants, which are so variable, have been cultivated from an ancient
  period, and, though they probably still receive more nutriment than in
  their natural state, yet they must have received during many generations
  nearly the same amount; and it might be thought that they would have
  become habituated to the excess. Nevertheless, on the whole, Knight's
  view, that excess of food is one of the most potent causes of
  variability, appears, as far as I can judge, probable.</p>

  <p>Whether or not our various cultivated plants have received nutriment
  in excess, all have been exposed to changes of various kinds. Fruit-trees
  are grafted on different stocks, and grown in various soils. The seeds of
  culinary and agricultural plants are carried from place to place; and
  during the last century the rotation of our crops and the manures used
  have been greatly changed.</p>

  <p>Slight changes of treatment often suffice to induce variability. The
  simple fact of almost all our cultivated plants and domesticated animals
  having varied in all places and at all times, leads to this conclusion.
  Seeds taken from common English forest-trees, grown under their native
  climate, not highly manured or otherwise artificially treated, yield
  seedlings which vary much, as may be seen in every extensive seed-bed. I
  have shown in a former chapter what a number of well marked and singular
  varieties the thorn (<i>Cratægus <span class="correction" title="Original reads `oxycantha', corrected by errata, page viii."
  >oxyacantha</span></i>) has produced; yet this tree has been subjected to
  hardly any cultivation. In Staffordshire I carefully examined a large
  number of two British plants, namely, <i>Geranium phæum</i> and
  <i>Pyrenaicum</i>, which have never been highly cultivated. These plants
  had spread spontaneously by seed from a common garden into an open
  plantation; and the seedlings varied in almost every single character,
  both in their flowers and foliage, to a degree which <!-- Page 259
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>{259}</span>I have never
  seen exceeded; yet they could not have been exposed to any great change
  in their conditions.</p>

  <p>With respect to animals, Azara has remarked with much surprise,<a
  name="NtA_614" href="#Nt_614"><sup>[614]</sup></a> that, whilst the feral
  horses on the Pampas are always of one of three colours, and the cattle
  always of a uniform colour, yet these animals, when bred on the
  unenclosed estancias, though kept in a state which can hardly be called
  domesticated, and apparently exposed to almost identically the same
  conditions as when they are feral, nevertheless display a great diversity
  of colour. So again in India several species of fresh-water fish are only
  so far treated artificially, that they are reared in great tanks; but
  this small change is sufficient to induce much variability.<a
  name="NtA_615" href="#Nt_615"><sup>[615]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Some facts on the effects of grafting, in regard to the variability of
  trees, deserve attention. Cabanis asserts that when certain pears are
  grafted on the quince, their seeds yield more varieties than do the seeds
  of the same variety of pear when grafted on the wild pear.<a
  name="NtA_616" href="#Nt_616"><sup>[616]</sup></a> But as the pear and
  quince are distinct species, though so closely related that the one can
  be readily grafted and succeeds admirably on the other, the fact of
  variability being thus caused is not surprising; we are, however, here
  enabled to see the cause, namely, the different nature of the stock with
  its roots and the rest of the tree. Several North American varieties of
  the plum and peach are well known to reproduce themselves truly by seed;
  but Downing asserts,<a name="NtA_617" href="#Nt_617"><sup>[617]</sup></a>
  "that when a graft is taken from one of these trees and placed upon
  another stock, this grafted tree is found to lose its singular property
  of producing the same variety by seed, and becomes like all other worked
  trees;"&mdash;that is, its seedlings become highly variable. Another case
  is worth giving: the Lalande variety of the walnut-tree leafs between
  April 20th and May 15th, and its seedlings invariably inherit the same
  habit; whilst several other varieties of the walnut leaf in June. Now, if
  seedlings are raised from the May-leafing Lalande variety, grafted on
  another May-leafing variety, though both stock and graft have the same
  early habit of leafing, yet the seedlings leaf at various times, <!--
  Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"></a>{260}</span>even
  as late as the 5th of June.<a name="NtA_618"
  href="#Nt_618"><sup>[618]</sup></a> Such facts as these are well fitted
  to show, on what obscure and slight causes variability rests.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>I may here just allude to the appearance of new and valuable varieties
  of fruit-trees and of wheat in woods and waste places, which at first
  sight seems a most anomalous circumstance. In France a considerable
  number of the best pears have been discovered in woods; and this has
  occurred so frequently, that Poiteau asserts that "improved varieties of
  our cultivated fruits rarely originate with nurserymen."<a name="NtA_619"
  href="#Nt_619"><sup>[619]</sup></a> In England, on the other hand, no
  instance of a good pear having been found wild has been recorded; and Mr.
  Rivers informs me that he knows of only one instance with apples, namely,
  the Bess Poole, which was discovered in a wood in Nottinghamshire. This
  difference between the two countries may be in part accounted for by the
  more favourable climate of France, but chiefly from the great number of
  seedlings which spring up there in the woods. I infer that this is the
  case from a remark made by a French gardener,<a name="NtA_620"
  href="#Nt_620"><sup>[620]</sup></a> who regards it as a national calamity
  that such a number of pear-trees are periodically cut down for firewood,
  before they have borne fruit. The new varieties which thus spring up in
  the woods, though they cannot have received any excess of nutriment, will
  have been exposed to abruptly changed conditions, but whether this is the
  cause of their production is very doubtful. These varieties, however, are
  probably all descended<a name="NtA_621"
  href="#Nt_621"><sup>[621]</sup></a> from old cultivated kinds growing in
  adjoining orchards,&mdash;a circumstance which will account for their
  variability; and out of a vast number of varying trees there will always
  be a good chance of the appearance of a valuable kind. In North America,
  where fruit-trees frequently spring up in waste places, the Washington
  pear was found in a hedge, and the Emperor peach in a wood.<a
  name="NtA_622" href="#Nt_622"><sup>[622]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With respect to wheat, some writers have spoken<a name="NtA_623"
  href="#Nt_623"><sup>[623]</sup></a> as if it were an ordinary event for
  new varieties to be found in waste places; the Fenton wheat was certainly
  discovered growing on a pile of basaltic detritus in a quarry, but in
  such a situation the plant would probably receive a sufficient amount
  <!-- Page 261 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page261"></a>{261}</span>of nutriment. The Chidham wheat was raised
  from an ear found <i>on</i> a hedge; and Hunter's wheat was discovered
  <i>by</i> the roadside in Scotland, but it is not said that this latter
  variety grew where it was found.<a name="NtA_624"
  href="#Nt_624"><sup>[624]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Whether our domestic productions would ever become so completely
  habituated to the conditions under which they now live, as to cease
  varying, we have no sufficient means for judging. But, in fact, our
  domestic productions are never exposed for a great length of time to
  uniform conditions, and it is certain that our most anciently cultivated
  plants, as well as animals, still go on varying, for all have recently
  undergone marked improvement. In some few cases, however, plants have
  become habituated to new conditions. Thus Metzger, who cultivated in
  Germany during many years numerous varieties of wheat, brought from
  different countries,<a name="NtA_625" href="#Nt_625"><sup>[625]</sup></a>
  states that some kinds were at first extremely variable, but gradually,
  in one instance after an interval of twenty-five years, became constant;
  and it does not appear that this resulted from the selection of the more
  constant forms.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>On the Accumulative Action of changed Conditions of
  Life.</i>&mdash;We have good grounds for believing that the influence of
  changed conditions accumulates, so that no effect is produced on a
  species until it has been exposed during several generations to continued
  cultivation or domestication. Universal experience shows us that when new
  flowers are first introduced into our gardens they do not vary; but
  ultimately all, with the rarest exceptions, vary to a greater or less
  extent. In a few cases the requisite number of generations, as well as
  the successive steps in the progress of variation, have been recorded, as
  in the often-quoted instance of the Dahlia.<a name="NtA_626"
  href="#Nt_626"><sup>[626]</sup></a> After several years' culture the
  Zinnia has only lately (1860) begun to vary in any great degree. "In the
  first seven or eight years of high cultivation the Swan River daisy
  (<i>Brachycome iberidifolia</i>) kept to its original colour; it then
  varied into lilac and purple and other minor shades."<a name="NtA_627"
  href="#Nt_627"><sup>[627]</sup></a> Analogous facts have been recorded
  with the Scotch rose. In discussing the variability of plants several
  experienced horticulturists have spoken to the <!-- Page 262 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>{262}</span>same general effect.
  Mr. Salter<a name="NtA_628" href="#Nt_628"><sup>[628]</sup></a> remarks,
  "Every one knows that the chief difficulty is in breaking through the
  original form and colour of the species, and every one will be on the
  look-out for any natural sport, either from seed or branch; that being
  once obtained, however trifling the change may be, the result depends
  upon himself." M. de Jonghe, who has had so much success in raising new
  varieties of pears and strawberries,<a name="NtA_629"
  href="#Nt_629"><sup>[629]</sup></a> remarks with respect to the former,
  "There is another principle, namely, that the more a type has entered
  into a state of variation, the greater is its tendency to continue doing
  so; and the more it has varied from the original type, the more it is
  disposed to vary still farther." We have, indeed, already discussed this
  latter point when treating of the power which man possesses, through
  selection, of continually augmenting in the same direction each
  modification; for this power depends on continued variability of the same
  general kind. The most celebrated horticulturist in France, namely,
  Vilmorin,<a name="NtA_630" href="#Nt_630"><sup>[630]</sup></a> even
  maintains that, when any particular variation is desired, the first step
  is to get the plant to vary in any manner whatever, and to go on
  selecting the most variable individuals, even though they vary in the
  wrong direction; for the fixed character of the species being once
  broken, the desired variation will sooner or later appear.</p>

  <p>As nearly all our animals were domesticated at an extremely remote
  epoch, we cannot, of course, say whether they varied quickly or slowly
  when first subjected to new conditions. But Dr. Bachman<a name="NtA_631"
  href="#Nt_631"><sup>[631]</sup></a> states that he has seen turkeys
  raised from the eggs of the wild species lose their metallic tints and
  become spotted with white in the third generation. Mr. Yarrell many years
  ago informed me that the wild ducks bred on the ponds in St. James's
  Park, which had never been crossed, as it is believed, with domestic
  ducks, lost their true plumage after a few generations. An excellent
  observer,<a name="NtA_632" href="#Nt_632"><sup>[632]</sup></a> who has
  often reared birds from the eggs of the wild duck, and who took
  precautions <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page263"></a>{263}</span>that there should be no crossing with
  domestic breeds, has given, as previously stated, full details on the
  changes which they gradually undergo. He found that he could not breed
  these wild ducks true for more than five or six generations, "as they
  then proved so much less beautiful. The white collar round the neck of
  the mallard became much broader and more irregular, and white feathers
  appeared in the ducklings' wings." They increased also in size of body;
  their legs became less fine, and they lost their elegant carriage. Fresh
  eggs were then procured from wild birds; but again the same result
  followed. In these cases of the duck and turkey we see that animals, like
  plants, do not depart from their primitive type until they have been
  subjected during several generations to domestication. On the other hand,
  Mr. Yarrell informed me that the Australian dingos, bred in the
  Zoological Gardens, almost invariably produced in the first generation
  puppies marked with white and other colours; but these introduced dingos
  had probably been procured from the natives, who keep them in a
  semi-domesticated state. It is certainly a remarkable fact that changed
  conditions should at first produce, as far as we can see, absolutely no
  effect; but that they should subsequently cause the character of the
  species to change. In the chapter on pangenesis I shall attempt to throw
  a little light on this fact.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Returning now to the causes which are supposed to induce variability.
  Some authors<a name="NtA_633" href="#Nt_633"><sup>[633]</sup></a> believe
  that close interbreeding gives this tendency, and leads to the production
  of monstrosities. In the seventeenth chapter some few facts were
  advanced, showing that monstrosities are, as it appears, occasionally
  thus caused; and there can be no doubt that close interbreeding induces
  lessened fertility and a weakened constitution; hence it may lead to
  variability: but I have not sufficient evidence on this head. On the
  other hand, close interbreeding, if not carried to an injurious extreme,
  far from causing variability, tends to fix the character of each
  breed.</p>

  <p>It was formerly a common belief, still held by some persons, that the
  imagination of the mother affects the child in <!-- Page 264 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>{264}</span>the womb.<a
  name="NtA_634" href="#Nt_634"><sup>[634]</sup></a> This view is evidently
  not applicable to the lower animals, which lay unimpregnated eggs, or to
  plants. Dr. William Hunter, in the last century, told my father that
  during many years every woman in a large London Lying-in Hospital was
  asked before her confinement whether anything had specially affected her
  mind, and the answer was written down; and it so happened that in no one
  instance could a coincidence be detected between the woman's answer and
  any abnormal structure; but when she knew the nature of the structure,
  she frequently suggested some fresh cause. The belief in the power of the
  mother's imagination may perhaps have arisen from the children of a
  second marriage resembling the previous father, as certainly sometimes
  occurs, in accordance with the facts given in the eleventh chapter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Crossing as a Cause of Variability.</i>&mdash;In an early part of
  this chapter it was stated that Pallas<a name="NtA_635"
  href="#Nt_635"><sup>[635]</sup></a> and a few other naturalists maintain
  that variability is wholly due to crossing. If this means that new
  characters never spontaneously appear in our domestic races, but that
  they are all directly derived from certain aboriginal species, the
  doctrine is little less than absurd; for it implies that animals like
  Italian greyhounds, pug-dogs, bull-dogs, pouter and fantail pigeons,
  &amp;c., were able to exist in a state of nature. But the doctrine may
  mean something widely different, namely, that the crossing of distinct
  species is the sole cause of the first appearance of new characters, and
  that without this aid man could not have formed his various breeds. As,
  however, new characters have appeared in certain cases by bud-variation,
  we may conclude with certainty that crossing is not necessary for
  variability. It is, moreover, almost certain that the breeds of various
  animals, such as of the rabbit, pigeon, duck, &amp;c., and the varieties
  of several plants, are the modified descendants of a single wild species.
  Nevertheless, it is probable that the crossing of two forms, when one or
  both have long been domesticated or cultivated, adds to the variability
  of the offspring, independently of the commingling of the characters
  derived from the two parent-forms; and this implies <!-- Page 265
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>{265}</span>that new
  characters actually arise. But we must not forget the facts advanced in
  the thirteenth chapter, which clearly prove that the act of crossing
  often leads to the reappearance or reversion of long-lost characters; and
  in most cases it would be impossible to distinguish between the
  reappearance of ancient characters and the first appearance of new
  characters. Practically, whether new or old, they would be new to the
  breed in which they reappeared.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Gärtner declares,<a name="NtA_636" href="#Nt_636"><sup>[636]</sup></a>
  and his experience is of the highest value on such a point, that, when he
  crossed native plants which had not been cultivated, he never once saw in
  the offspring any new character; but that from the odd manner in which
  the characters derived from the parents were combined, they sometimes
  appeared as if new. When, on the other hand, he crossed cultivated
  plants, he admits that new characters occasionally appeared, but he is
  strongly inclined to attribute their appearance to ordinary variability,
  not in any way to the cross. An opposite conclusion, however, appears to
  me the more probable. According to Kölreuter, hybrids in the genus
  Mirabilis vary almost infinitely, and he describes new and singular
  characters in the form of the seeds, in the colour of the anthers, in the
  cotyledons being of immense size, in new and highly peculiar odours, in
  the flowers expanding early in the season, and in their closing at night.
  With respect to one lot of these hybrids, he remarks that they presented
  characters exactly the reverse of what might have been expected from
  their parentage.<a name="NtA_637" href="#Nt_637"><sup>[637]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Prof. Lecoq<a name="NtA_638" href="#Nt_638"><sup>[638]</sup></a>
  speaks strongly to the same effect in regard to this same genus, and
  asserts that many of the hybrids from <i>Mirabilis jalapa</i> and
  <i>multiflora</i> might easily be mistaken for distinct species, and adds
  that they differed in a greater degree, than the other species of the
  genus, from <i>M. jalapa</i>. Herbert, also, has described<a
  name="NtA_639" href="#Nt_639"><sup>[639]</sup></a> the offspring from a
  hybrid Rhododendron as being "as <i>unlike all others</i> in foliage, as
  if they had been a separate species." The common experience of
  floriculturists proves that the crossing and recrossing of distinct but
  allied plants, such as the species of Petunia, Calceolaria, Fuchsia,
  Verbena, &amp;c., induces excessive variability; hence the appearance of
  quite new characters is probable. M. Carrière<a name="NtA_640"
  href="#Nt_640"><sup>[640]</sup></a> has lately discussed this subject: he
  states that <i>Erythrina cristagalli</i> had been multiplied by seed for
  many years, but had not yielded any varieties: it was then crossed with
  the allied <i>E. herbacea</i>, and "the resistance was now overcome, and
  varieties were produced with flowers of extremely different size, form,
  and colour."</p>

  <p>From the general and apparently well-founded belief that the crossing
  <!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page266"></a>{266}</span>of distinct species, besides commingling
  their characters, adds greatly to their variability, it has probably
  arisen that some botanists have gone so far as to maintain<a
  name="NtA_641" href="#Nt_641"><sup>[641]</sup></a> that, when a genus
  includes only a single species, this when cultivated never varies. The
  proposition made so broadly cannot be admitted; but it is probably true
  that the variability of cultivated monotypic genera is much less than
  that of genera including numerous species, and this quite independently
  of the effects of crossing. I have stated in my 'Origin of Species,' and
  in a future work shall more fully show, that the species belonging to
  small genera generally yield a less number of varieties in a state of
  nature than those belonging to large genera. Hence the species of small
  genera would, it is probable, produce fewer varieties under cultivation
  than the already variable species of larger genera.</p>

  <p>Although we have not at present sufficient evidence that the crossing
  of species, which have never been cultivated, leads to the appearance of
  new characters, this apparently does occur with species which have been
  already rendered in some degree variable through cultivation. Hence
  crossing, like any other change in the conditions of life, seems to be an
  element, probably a potent one, in causing variability. But we seldom
  have the means of distinguishing, as previously remarked, between the
  appearance of really new characters and the reappearance of long-lost
  characters, evoked through the act of crossing. I will give an instance
  of the difficulty in distinguishing such cases. The species of Datura may
  be divided into two sections, those having white flowers with green
  stems, and those having purple flowers with brown stems: now Naudin<a
  name="NtA_642" href="#Nt_642"><sup>[642]</sup></a> crossed <i>Datura
  lævis</i> and <i>ferox</i>, both of which belong to the white section,
  and raised from them 205 hybrids. Of these hybrids, every one had brown
  stems and bore purple flowers; so that they resembled the species of the
  other section of the genus, and not their own two parents. Naudin was so
  much astonished at this fact, that he was led carefully to observe both
  parent-species, and he discovered that the pure seedlings of <i>D.
  ferox</i>, immediately after germination, had dark purple stems,
  extending from the young roots up to the cotyledons, and that this tint
  remained ever afterwards as a ring round the base of the stem of the
  plant when old. Now I have shown in the thirteenth chapter that the
  retention or exaggeration of an early character is so intimately related
  to reversion, that it evidently comes under the same principle. Hence
  probably we ought to look at the purple flowers and brown stems of these
  hybrids, not as new characters due to variability, but as a return to the
  former state of some ancient progenitor.</p>

  <p>Independently of the appearance of new characters from crossing, a few
  words may be added to what has been said in former chapters on the
  unequal combination and transmission of the characters proper to the two
  parent-forms. When two species or races are crossed, the offspring of
  <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page267"></a>{267}</span>the first generation are generally
  uniform, but subsequently they display an almost infinite diversity of
  character. He who wishes, says Kölreuter,<a name="NtA_643"
  href="#Nt_643"><sup>[643]</sup></a> to obtain an endless number of
  varieties from hybrids should cross and recross them. There is also much
  variability when hybrids or mongrels are reduced or absorbed by repeated
  crosses with either pure parent-form; and a still higher degree of
  variability when three distinct species, and most of all when four
  species, are blended together by successive crosses. Beyond this point
  Gärtner,<a name="NtA_644" href="#Nt_644"><sup>[644]</sup></a> on whose
  authority the foregoing statements are made, never succeeded in effecting
  a union; but Max Wichura<a name="NtA_645"
  href="#Nt_645"><sup>[645]</sup></a> united six distinct species of
  willows into a single hybrid. The sex of the parent-species affects in an
  inexplicable manner the degree of variability of hybrids; for Gärtner<a
  name="NtA_646" href="#Nt_646"><sup>[646]</sup></a> repeatedly found that
  when a hybrid was used as the father, and either one of the pure
  parent-species, or a third species, was used as the mother, the offspring
  were more variable than when the same hybrid was used as the mother, and
  either pure parent or the same third species as the father: thus
  seedlings from <i>Dianthus barbatus</i> crossed by the hybrid <i>D.
  chinensi-barbatus</i> were more variable than those raised from this
  latter hybrid fertilised by the pure <i>D. barbatus</i>. Max Wichura<a
  name="NtA_647" href="#Nt_647"><sup>[647]</sup></a> insists strongly on an
  analogous result with his hybrid willows. Again Gärtner<a name="NtA_648"
  href="#Nt_648"><sup>[648]</sup></a> asserts that the degree of
  variability sometimes differs in hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses
  between the same two species; and here the sole difference is, that the
  one species is first used as the father and then as the mother. On the
  whole we see that, independently of the appearance of new characters, the
  variability of successive crossed generations is extremely complex,
  partly from the offspring partaking unequally of the characters of the
  two parent-forms, and more especially from their unequal tendency to
  revert to these same characters or to those of more ancient
  progenitors.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>On the Manner and on the Period of Action of the Causes which
  induce Variability.</i>&mdash;This is an extremely obscure subject, and
  we need here only briefly consider, firstly, whether inherited variations
  are caused by the organisation being directly acted on, or indirectly
  through the reproductive system; and secondly, at what period of life or
  growth they are primarily caused. We shall see in the two following
  chapters that various agencies, such as an abundant supply of food,
  exposure to a different climate, increased use or disuse of parts,
  &amp;c., prolonged during several generations, certainly modify either
  the whole organisation or certain organs. This direct action of changed
  conditions perhaps comes into play much more frequently than can be
  proved, and it is at least clear that in all cases of <!-- Page 268
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>{268}</span>bud-variation
  the action cannot have been through the reproductive system.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>With respect to the part which the reproductive system takes in
  causing variability, we have seen in the eighteenth chapter that even
  slight changes in the conditions of life have a remarkable power in
  causing a greater or less degree of sterility. Hence it seems not
  improbable that being generated though a system so easily affected should
  themselves be affected, or should fail to inherit, or inherit in excess,
  characters proper to their parents. We know that certain groups of
  organic beings, but with exceptions in each group, have their
  reproductive systems much more easily affected by changed conditions than
  other groups; for instance, carnivorous birds more readily than
  carnivorous mammals, and parrots more readily than pigeons; and this fact
  harmonizes with the apparently capricious manner and degree in which
  various groups of animals and plants vary under domestication.</p>

  <p>Kölreuter<a name="NtA_649" href="#Nt_649"><sup>[649]</sup></a> was
  struck with the parallelism between the excessive variability of hybrids
  when crossed and recrossed in various ways,&mdash;these hybrids having
  their reproductive powers more or less affected,&mdash;and the
  variability of anciently cultivated plants. Max Wichura<a name="NtA_650"
  href="#Nt_650"><sup>[650]</sup></a> has gone one step farther, and shows
  that with many of our highly cultivated plants, such as the hyacinth,
  tulip, auricula, snapdragon, potato, cabbage, &amp;c., which there is no
  reason to believe have been hybridized, the anthers contain many
  irregular pollen-grains, in the same state as in hybrids. He finds also
  in certain wild forms, the same coincidence between the state of the
  pollen and a high degree of variability, as in many species of Rubus; but
  in <i>R. cæsius</i> and <i>idæus</i>, which are not highly variable
  species, the pollen is sound. It is also notorious that many cultivated
  plants, such as the banana, pine-apple, breadfruit, and others previously
  mentioned, have their reproductive organs so seriously affected as to be
  generally quite sterile; and when they do yield seed, the seedlings,
  judging from the large number of cultivated races which exist, must be
  variable in an extreme degree. These facts indicate that there is some
  relation between the state of the reproductive organs and a tendency to
  variability; but we must not conclude that the relation is strict.
  Although many of our highly cultivated plants may have their pollen in a
  deteriorated condition, yet, as we have previously seen, they yield more
  seed, and our anciently domesticated animals are more prolific, than the
  corresponding species in a state of nature. The peacock is almost the
  only bird which is believed to be less fertile under domestication than
  in its native state, and it has varied in a remarkably small degree. From
  these considerations it would seem that changes in the conditions of life
  lead either to sterility or to variability, or to both; and not that
  sterility induces variability. On the whole it is probable that any cause
  affecting the organs of reproduction would likewise affect their
  product,&mdash;that is, the offspring thus generated.</p>

<p><!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269"></a>{269}</span></p>

  <p>The period of life at which the causes that induce variability act, is
  another obscure subject, which has been discussed by various authors.<a
  name="NtA_651" href="#Nt_651"><sup>[651]</sup></a> In some of the cases,
  to be given in the following chapter, of modifications from the direct
  action of changed conditions, which are inherited, there can be no doubt
  that the causes have acted on the mature or nearly mature animal. On the
  other hand, monstrosities, which cannot be distinctly separated from
  lesser variations, are often caused by the embryo being injured whilst in
  the mother's womb or in the egg. Thus I. Geoffroy St. Hilaire<a
  name="NtA_652" href="#Nt_652"><sup>[652]</sup></a> asserts that poor
  women who work hard during their pregnancy, and the mothers of
  illegitimate children troubled in their minds and forced to conceal their
  state, are far more liable to give birth to monsters than women in easy
  circumstances. The eggs of the fowl when placed upright or otherwise
  treated unnaturally frequently produce monstrous chickens. It would,
  however, appear that complex monstrosities are induced more frequently
  during a rather late than during a very early period of embryonic life;
  but this may partly result from some one part, which has been injured
  during an early period, affecting by its abnormal growth other parts
  subsequently developed; and this would be less likely to occur with parts
  injured at a later period.<a name="NtA_653"
  href="#Nt_653"><sup>[653]</sup></a> When any part or organ becomes
  monstrous through abortion, a rudiment is generally left, and this
  likewise indicates that its development had already commenced.</p>

  <p>Insects sometimes have their antennæ or legs in a monstrous condition,
  and yet the larvæ from which they are metamorphosed do not possess either
  antennæ or legs; and in those cases, as Quatrefages<a name="NtA_654"
  href="#Nt_654"><sup>[654]</sup></a> believes, we are enabled to see the
  precise period at which the normal progress of development has been
  troubled. But the nature of the food given to a caterpillar sometimes
  affects the colours of the moth, without the caterpillar itself being
  affected; therefore it seems possible that other characters in the mature
  insect might be indirectly modified through the larvæ. There is no reason
  to suppose that organs which have been rendered monstrous have always
  been acted on during their development; the cause may have acted on the
  organisation at a much earlier stage. It is even probable that either the
  male or female sexual elements, or both, before their union, may be
  affected in such a manner as to lead to modifications in organs developed
  at a late period of life; in nearly the same manner as a child may
  inherit from his father a disease which does not appear until old
  age.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the facts above given, which prove that in many
  cases a close relation exists between variability and the sterility
  following from changed conditions, we may conclude that the exciting
  cause often acts at the earliest possible period, namely, on the sexual
  elements, before impregnation has taken place. That an affection of the
  female sexual element may induce variability we may likewise infer as
  probable from the occurrence of bud-variations; for a bud seems to be the
  analogue of an ovule. But the male element is apparently much oftener
  affected by changed <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page270"></a>{270}</span>conditions, at least in a visible manner,
  than the female element or ovule; and we know from Gärtner's and
  Wichura's statements that a hybrid used as the father and crossed with a
  pure species gives a greater degree of variability to the offspring, than
  does the same hybrid when used as the mother. Lastly, it is certain that
  variability may be transmitted through either sexual element, whether or
  not originally excited in them, for Kölreuter and Gärtner<a
  name="NtA_655" href="#Nt_655"><sup>[655]</sup></a> found that when two
  species were crossed, if either one was variable, the offspring were
  rendered variable.</p>

</blockquote>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Summary.</i>&mdash;From the facts given in this chapter, we may
  conclude that the variability of organic beings under domestication,
  although so general, is not an inevitable contingent on growth and
  reproduction, but results from the conditions to which the parents have
  been exposed. Changes of any kind in the conditions of life, even
  extremely slight changes, often suffice to cause variability. Excess of
  nutriment is perhaps the most efficient single exciting cause. Animals
  and plants continue to be variable for an immense period after their
  first domestication; but the conditions to which they are exposed never
  long remain quite constant. In the course of time they can be habituated
  to certain changes, so as to become less variable; and it is possible
  that when first domesticated they may have been even more variable than
  at present. There is good evidence that the power of changed conditions
  accumulates; so that two, three, or more generations must be exposed to
  new conditions before any effect is visible. The crossing of distinct
  forms, which have already become variable, increases in the offspring the
  tendency to further variability, by the unequal commingling of the
  characters of the two parents, by the reappearance of long-lost
  characters, and by the appearance of absolutely new characters. Some
  variations are induced by the direct action of the surrounding conditions
  on the whole organisation, or on certain parts alone, and other
  variations are induced indirectly through the reproductive system being
  affected in the same manner as is so common with organic beings when
  removed from their natural conditions. The causes which induce
  variability act on the mature organism, on the embryo, and, as we have
  good reason to believe, on both sexual elements before impregnation has
  been effected.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If we ask ourselves why this or that character has been modified under
  domestication, we are, in most cases lost in utter darkness. Many
  naturalists, especially of the French school, attribute every
  modification to the "monde ambiant," that is, to changed climate, with
  all its diversities of heat and cold, dampness and dryness, light and
  electricity, to the nature of the soil, and to varied kinds and amount of
  food. By the term definite action, as used in this chapter, I mean an
  action of such a nature that, when many individuals of the same variety
  are exposed during several generations to any change in their physical
  conditions of life, all, or nearly all the individuals, are modified in
  the same manner. A new sub-variety would thus be produced without the aid
  of selection.</p>

  <p>I do not include under the term of definite action the effects of
  habit or of the increased use and disuse of various organs. Modifications
  of this nature, no doubt, are definitely caused by the conditions to
  which the beings are subjected; but they depend much less on the nature
  of the conditions than on the laws of growth; hence they are included
  under a distinct head in the <!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page272"></a>{272}</span>following chapter. We know, however, far
  too little of the causes and laws of variation to make a sound
  classification. The direct action of the conditions of life, whether
  leading to definite or indefinite results, is a totally distinct
  consideration from the effects of natural selection; for natural
  selection depends on the survival under various and complex circumstances
  of the best-fitted individuals, but has no relation whatever to the
  primary cause of any modification of structure.</p>

  <p>I will first give in detail all the facts which I have been able to
  collect, rendering it probable that climate, food, &amp;c., have acted so
  definitely and powerfully on the organisation of our domesticated
  productions, that they have sufficed to form new sub-varieties or races,
  without the aid of selection by man or of natural selection. I will then
  give the facts and considerations opposed to this conclusion, and finally
  we will weigh, as fairly as we can, the evidence on both sides.</p>

  <p>When we reflect that distinct races of almost all our domesticated
  animals exist in each kingdom of Europe, and formerly even in each
  district of England, we are at first strongly inclined to attribute their
  origin to the definite action of the physical conditions of each country;
  and this has been the conclusion of many authors. But we should bear in
  mind that man annually has to choose which animals shall be preserved for
  breeding, and which shall be slaughtered. We have also seen that both
  methodical and unconscious selection were formerly practised, and are now
  occasionally practised by the most barbarous races, to a much greater
  extent than might have been anticipated. Hence it is very difficult to
  judge how far the difference in conditions between, for instance, the
  several districts in England, could have sufficed without the aid of
  selection to modify the breeds which have been reared in each. It may be
  argued that, as numerous wild animals and plants have ranged during many
  ages throughout Great Britain, and still retain the same character, the
  difference in conditions between the several districts could not have
  modified in so marked a manner the various native races of cattle, sheep,
  pigs, and horses. The same difficulty of distinguishing between selection
  and the definite effects of the conditions of life, is encountered in a
  still higher degree when we compare closely allied natural <!-- Page 273
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>{273}</span>forms,
  inhabiting two countries, such as North America and Europe, which do not
  differ greatly in climate, nature of soil, &amp;c., for in this case
  natural selection will inevitably and rigorously have acted during a long
  succession of ages.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>From the importance of the difficulty just alluded to, it will be
  advisable to give as large a body of facts as possible, showing that
  extremely slight differences in treatment, either in different parts of
  the same country, or during different seasons, certainly cause an
  appreciable effect, at least on varieties which are already in an
  unstable condition. Ornamental flowers are good for this purpose, as they
  are highly variable, and are carefully observed. All floriculturists are
  unanimous that certain varieties are affected by very slight differences
  in the nature of the artificial compost in which they are grown, and by
  the natural soil of the district, and by the season. Thus, a skilful
  judge, in writing on Carnations and Picotees,<a name="NtA_656"
  href="#Nt_656"><sup>[656]</sup></a> asks "where can Admiral Curzon be
  seen possessing the colour, size, and strength which it has in
  Derbyshire? Where can Flora's Garland be found equal to those at Slough?
  Where do high-coloured flowers revel better than at Woolwich and
  Birmingham? Yet in no two of these districts do the same varieties attain
  an equal degree of excellence, although each may be receiving the
  attention of the most skilful cultivators." The same writer then
  recommends every cultivator to keep five different kinds of soil and
  manure, "and to endeavour to suit the respective appetites of the plants
  you are dealing with, for without such attention all hope of general
  success will be vain." So it is with the Dahlia:<a name="NtA_657"
  href="#Nt_657"><sup>[657]</sup></a> the Lady Cooper rarely succeeds near
  London, but does admirably in other districts; the reverse holds good
  with other varieties; and again, there are others which succeed equally
  well in various situations. A skilful gardener<a name="NtA_658"
  href="#Nt_658"><sup>[658]</sup></a> states that he procured cuttings of
  an old and well-known variety (pulchella) of Verbena, which from having
  been propagated in a different situation presented a slightly different
  shade of colour; the two varieties were afterwards multiplied by
  cuttings, being carefully kept distinct; but in the second year they
  could hardly be distinguished, and in the third year no one could
  distinguish them.</p>

  <p>The nature of the season has an especial influence on certain
  varieties of the Dahlia: in 1841 two varieties were pre-eminently good,
  and the next year these same two were pre-eminently bad. A famous
  amateur<a name="NtA_659" href="#Nt_659"><sup>[659]</sup></a> asserts that
  in 1861 many varieties of the Rose came so untrue in character, "that it
  was hardly possible to recognise them, and the thought was not seldom
  entertained that the grower had lost his tally." The same amateur<a
  name="NtA_660" href="#Nt_660"><sup>[660]</sup></a> states that in 1862
  two-thirds of his Auriculas produced central trusses of flowers, and
  these are remarkable from not keeping true; <!-- Page 274 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page274"></a>{274}</span>and he adds that in
  some seasons certain varieties of this plant all prove good, and the next
  season all prove bad; whilst exactly the reverse happens with other
  varieties. In 1845 the editor of the 'Gardener's Chronicle'<a
  name="NtA_661" href="#Nt_661"><sup>[661]</sup></a> remarked how singular
  it was that this year many Calceolarias tended to assume a tubular form.
  With Heartsease<a name="NtA_662" href="#Nt_662"><sup>[662]</sup></a> the
  blotched sorts do not acquire their proper character until hot weather
  sets in; whilst other varieties lose their beautiful marks as soon as
  this occurs.</p>

  <p>Analogous facts have been observed with leaves: Mr. Beaton asserts<a
  name="NtA_663" href="#Nt_663"><sup>[663]</sup></a> that he raised at
  Shrubland, during six years, twenty thousand seedlings from the Punch
  Pelargonium, and not one had variegated leaves; but at Surbiton, in
  Surrey, one-third, or even a greater proportion, of the seedlings from
  this same variety were more or less variegated. The soil of another
  district in Surrey has a strong tendency to cause variegation, as appears
  from information given me by Sir F. Pollock. Verlot<a name="NtA_664"
  href="#Nt_664"><sup>[664]</sup></a> states that the variegated strawberry
  retains its character as long as grown in a dryish soil, but soon loses
  it when planted in fresh and humid soil. Mr. Salter, who is well known
  for his success in cultivating variegated plants, informs me that rows of
  strawberries were planted in his garden in 1859, in the usual way; and at
  various distances in one row, several plants simultaneously became
  variegated, and what made the case more extraordinary, all were
  variegated in precisely the same manner. These plants were removed, but
  during the three succeeding years other plants in the same row became
  variegated, and in no instance were the plants in any adjoining row
  affected.</p>

  <p>The chemical qualities, odours, and tissues of plants are often
  modified by a change which seems to us slight. The Hemlock is said not to
  yield conicine in Scotland. The root of the <i>Aconitum napellus</i>
  becomes innocuous in frigid climates. The medicinal properties of the
  Digitalis are easily affected by culture. The Rhubarb flourishes in
  England, but does not produce the medicinal substance which makes the
  plant so valuable in Chinese Tartary. As the <i>Pistacia lentiscus</i>
  grows abundantly in the South of France, the climate must suit it, but it
  yields no mastic. The <i>Laurus sassafras</i> in Europe loses the odour
  proper to it in North America.<a name="NtA_665"
  href="#Nt_665"><sup>[665]</sup></a> Many similar facts could be given,
  and they are remarkable because it might have been thought that definite
  chemical compounds would have been little liable to change either in
  quality or quantity.</p>

  <p>The wood of the American Locust-tree (<i>Robinia</i>) when grown in
  England is nearly worthless, as is that of the Oak-tree when grown at the
  Cape of Good Hope.<a name="NtA_666" href="#Nt_666"><sup>[666]</sup></a>
  Hemp and flax, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, flourish and yield plenty of
  seed on the plains of India, but their fibres are brittle <!-- Page 275
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>{275}</span>and useless.
  Hemp, on the other hand, fails to produce in England that resinous matter
  which is so largely used in India as an intoxicating drug.</p>

  <p>The fruit of the Melon is greatly influenced by slight differences in
  culture and climate. Hence it is generally a better plan, according to
  Naudin, to improve an old kind than to introduce a new one into any
  locality. The seed of the Persian Melon produces near Paris fruit
  inferior to the poorest market kinds, but at Bordeaux yields delicious
  fruit.<a name="NtA_667" href="#Nt_667"><sup>[667]</sup></a> Seed is
  annually brought from Thibet to Kashmir,<a name="NtA_668"
  href="#Nt_668"><sup>[668]</sup></a> and produces fruit weighing from four
  to ten pounds, but plants raised from seed saved in Kashmir next year
  give fruit weighing only from two to three pounds. It is well known that
  American varieties of the Apple produce in their native land magnificent
  and brightly-coloured fruit, but in England of poor quality and a dull
  colour. In Hungary there are many varieties of the Kidney-bean,
  remarkable for the beauty of their seeds, but the Rev. M.&nbsp;J. Berkeley<a
  name="NtA_669" href="#Nt_669"><sup>[669]</sup></a> found that their
  beauty could hardly ever be preserved in England, and in some cases the
  colour was greatly changed. We have seen in the ninth chapter, with
  respect to wheat, what a remarkable effect transportal from the North to
  the South of France, and reversely, produced on the weight of the
  grain.</p>

  <p>When man can perceive no change in plants or animals which have been
  exposed to a new climate or to different treatment, insects can sometimes
  perceive a marked change. The same species of cactus has been carried to
  India from Canton, Manilla, Mauritius, and from the hot-houses of Kew,
  and there is likewise a so-called native kind, formerly introduced from
  South America; all these plants are alike in appearance, but the
  cochineal insect flourishes only on the native kind, on which it thrives
  prodigiously.<a name="NtA_670" href="#Nt_670"><sup>[670]</sup></a>
  Humboldt remarks<a name="NtA_671" href="#Nt_671"><sup>[671]</sup></a>
  that white men "born in the torrid zone walk barefoot with impunity in
  the same apartment where a European, recently landed, is exposed to the
  attacks of the <i>Pulex penetrans</i>." This insect, the too well-known
  chigoe, must therefore be able to distinguish what the most delicate
  chemical analysis fails to distinguish, namely, a difference between the
  blood or tissues of a European and those of a white man born in the
  country. But the discernment of the chigoe is not so surprising as it at
  first appears; for <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page276"></a>{276}</span>according to Liebig<a name="NtA_672"
  href="#Nt_672"><sup>[672]</sup></a> the blood of men with different
  complexions, though inhabiting the same country, emits a different
  odour.</p>

  <p>Diseases peculiar to certain localities, heights, or climates, may be
  here briefly noticed, as showing the influence of external circumstances
  on the human body. Diseases confined to certain races of man do not
  concern us, for the constitution of the race may play the more important
  part, and this may have been determined by unknown causes. The Plica
  Polonica stands, in this respect, in a nearly intermediate position; for
  it rarely affects Germans, who inhabit the neighbourhood of the Vistula,
  where so many Poles are grievously affected; and on the other hand, it
  does not affect Russians, who are said to belong to the same original
  stock with the Poles.<a name="NtA_673"
  href="#Nt_673"><sup>[673]</sup></a> The elevation of a district often
  governs the appearance of diseases; in Mexico the yellow fever does not
  extend above 924 mètres; and in Peru, people are affected with the
  <i>verugas</i> only between 600 and 1600 mètres above the sea; many other
  such cases could be given. A peculiar cutaneous complaint, called the
  <i>Bouton d'Alep</i>, affects in Aleppo and some neighbouring districts
  almost every native infant, and some few strangers; and it seems fairly
  well established that this singular complaint depends on drinking certain
  waters. In the healthy little island of St. Helena the scarlet-fever is
  dreaded like the Plague; analogous facts have been observed in Chili and
  Mexico.<a name="NtA_674" href="#Nt_674"><sup>[674]</sup></a> Even in the
  different departments of France it is found that the various infirmities

  the distribution of disease will be struck with surprise at what slight
  differences in the surrounding circumstances govern the nature and
  severity of the complaints by which man is at least temporarily
  affected.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The modifications as yet referred to have been extremely slight, and
  in most cases have been caused, as far as we can judge, by equally slight
  changes in the conditions. But can it be safely maintained that such
  changed conditions, if acting during a long series of generations, would
  not produce a marked effect? It is commonly believed that the people of
  the United States differ in appearance from the parent Anglo-Saxon race;
  and selection cannot have come into action within so short a period. A
  good observer<a name="NtA_676" href="#Nt_676"><sup>[676]</sup></a> states
  that a general absence of fat, <!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page277"></a>{277}</span>a thin and elongated neck, stiff and lank
  hair, are the chief characteristics. The change in the nature of the hair
  is supposed to be caused by the dryness of the atmosphere. If immigration
  into the United States were now stopped, who can say that the character
  of the whole people would not be greatly modified in the course of two or
  three thousand years?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The direct and definite action of changed conditions, in
  contradistinction to the accumulation of indefinite variations, seems to
  me so important that I will give a large additional body of miscellaneous
  facts. With plants, a considerable change of climate sometimes produces a
  conspicuous result. I have given in detail in the ninth chapter the most
  remarkable case known to me, namely, that in Germany several varieties of
  maize brought from the hotter parts of America were transformed in the
  course of only two or three generations. Dr. Falconer informs me that he
  has seen the English Ribston-pippin apple, a Himalayan oak, Prunus and
  Pyrus, all assume in the hotter parts of India a fastigate or pyramidal
  habit; and this fact is the more interesting, as a Chinese tropical
  species of Pyrus naturally has this habit of growth. Although in these
  cases the changed manner of growth seems to have been directly caused by
  the great heat, we know that many fastigate trees have originated in
  their temperate homes. In the Botanic Gardens of Ceylon the apple-tree<a
  name="NtA_677" href="#Nt_677"><sup>[677]</sup></a> "sends out numerous
  runners under ground, which continually rise into small stems, and form a
  growth around the parent-tree." The varieties of the cabbage which
  produce heads in Europe fail to do so in certain tropical countries.<a
  name="NtA_678" href="#Nt_678"><sup>[678]</sup></a> The <i>Rhododendron
  ciliatum</i> produced at Kew flowers so much larger and paler-coloured
  than those which it bears on its native Himalayan mountain, that Dr.
  Hooker<a name="NtA_679" href="#Nt_679"><sup>[679]</sup></a> would hardly
  have recognised the species by the flowers alone. Many similar facts with
  respect to the colour and size of flowers could be given.</p>

  <p>The experiments of Vilmorin and Buckman on carrots and parsnips prove
  that abundant nutriment produces a definite and inheritable effect on the
  so-called roots, with scarcely any change in other parts of the plant.
  Alum directly influences the colour of the flowers of the Hydrangea.<a
  name="NtA_680" href="#Nt_680"><sup>[680]</sup></a> Dryness seems
  generally to favour the hairyness or villosity of plants. Gärtner found
  that hybrid Verbascums became extremely woolly when grown in pots. Mr.
  Masters, on the other hand, states that the <i>Opuntia leucotricha</i>
  "is well clothed with beautiful white hairs when grown in a damp heat;
  but in a dry heat exhibits none of this peculiarity."<a name="NtA_681"
  href="#Nt_681"><sup>[681]</sup></a> Slight variations of many kinds, not
  worth specifying in detail, are retained only as <!-- Page 278 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>{278}</span>long as plants are
  grown in certain soils, of which Sageret<a name="NtA_682"
  href="#Nt_682"><sup>[682]</sup></a> gives from his own experience some
  instances. Odart, who insists strongly on the permanence of the varieties
  of the grape, admits<a name="NtA_683" href="#Nt_683"><sup>[683]</sup></a>
  that some varieties, when grown under a different climate or treated
  differently, vary in an extremely slight degree, as in the tint of the
  fruit and in the period of ripening. Some authors have denied that
  grafting causes even the slightest difference in the scion; but there is
  sufficient evidence that the fruit is sometimes slightly affected in size
  and flavour, the leaves in duration, and the flowers in appearance.<a
  name="NtA_684" href="#Nt_684"><sup>[684]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With animals there can be no doubt, from the facts given in the first
  chapter, that European dogs deteriorate in India, not only in their
  instincts but in structure; but the changes which they undergo are of
  such a nature, that they may be partly due to reversion to a primitive
  form, as in the case of feral animals. In parts of India the turkey
  becomes reduced in size, "with the pendulous appendage over the beak
  enormously developed."<a name="NtA_685"
  href="#Nt_685"><sup>[685]</sup></a> We have seen how soon the wild duck,
  when domesticated, loses its true character, from the effects of abundant
  or changed food, or from taking little exercise. From the direct action
  of a humid climate and poor pasture the horse rapidly decreases in size
  in the Falkland Islands. From information which I have received, this
  seems likewise to be the case to a certain extent with sheep in
  Australia.</p>

  <p>Climate definitely influences the hairy covering of animals; in the
  West Indies a great change is produced in the fleece of sheep, in about
  three generations. Dr. Falconer states<a name="NtA_686"
  href="#Nt_686"><sup>[686]</sup></a> that the Thibet mastiff and goat,
  when brought down from the Himalaya to Kashmir, lose their fine wool. At
  Angora not only goats, but shepherd-dogs and cats, have fine fleecy hair,
  and Mr. Ainsworth<a name="NtA_687" href="#Nt_687"><sup>[687]</sup></a>
  attributes the thickness of the fleece to the severe winters, and its
  silky lustre to the hot summers. Burnes states positively<a
  name="NtA_688" href="#Nt_688"><sup>[688]</sup></a> that the Karakool
  sheep lose their peculiar black curled fleeces when removed into any
  other country. Even within the limits of England, I have been assured
  that with two breeds of sheep the wool was slightly changed by the flocks
  being pastured in different localities.<a name="NtA_689"
  href="#Nt_689"><sup>[689]</sup></a> It has been asserted on good
  authority<a name="NtA_690" href="#Nt_690"><sup>[690]</sup></a> that
  horses kept during several years in the deep coal-mines of Belgium become
  covered with velvety hair, almost like that on the mole. These cases
  probably stand in close relation to the natural change of coat in winter
  and summer. Naked varieties of several domestic animals have occasionally
  appeared; but there is no reason to <!-- Page 279 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page279"></a>{279}</span>believe that this is in
  any way related to the nature of the climate to which they have been
  exposed.<a name="NtA_691" href="#Nt_691"><sup>[691]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It appears at first sight probable that the increased size, the
  tendency to fatten, the early maturity and altered forms of our improved
  cattle, sheep, and pigs, have directly resulted from their abundant
  supply of food. This is the opinion of many competent judges, and
  probably is to a great extent true. But as far as form is concerned, we
  must not overlook the equal or more potent influence of lessened use on
  the limbs and lungs. We see, moreover, as far as size is concerned, that
  selection is apparently a more powerful agent than a large supply of
  food, for we can thus only account for the existence, as remarked to me
  by Mr. Blyth, of the largest and smallest breeds of sheep in the same
  country, of Cochin-China fowls and Bantams, of small Tumbler and large
  Runt pigeons, all kept together and supplied with abundant nourishment.
  Nevertheless there can be little doubt that our domesticated animals have
  been modified, independently of the increased or lessened use of parts,
  by the conditions to which they have been subjected, without the aid of
  selection. For instance, Prof. Rütimeyer<a name="NtA_692"
  href="#Nt_692"><sup>[692]</sup></a> shows that the bones of all
  domesticated quadrupeds can be distinguished from those of wild animals
  by the state of their surface and general appearance. It is scarcely
  possible to read Nathusius's excellent 'Vorstudien,'<a name="NtA_693"
  href="#Nt_693"><sup>[693]</sup></a> and doubt that, with the highly
  improved races of the pig, abundant food has produced a conspicuous
  effect on the general form of the body, on the breadth of the head and
  face, and even on the teeth. Nathusius rests much on the case of a purely
  bred Berkshire pig, which when two months old became diseased in its
  digestive organs, and was preserved for observation until nineteen months
  old; at this age it had lost several characteristic features of the
  breed, and had acquired a long, narrow head, of large size relatively to
  its small body, and elongated legs. But in this case and in some others
  we ought not to assume that, because certain characters are lost, perhaps
  through reversion, under one course of treatment, therefore that they had
  been at first directly produced by an opposite course.</p>

  <p>In the case of the rabbit, which has become feral on the island of
  Porto Santo, we are at first strongly tempted to attribute the whole
  change&mdash;the greatly reduced size, the altered tints of the fur, and
  the loss of certain characteristic marks&mdash;to the definite action of
  the new conditions to which it has been exposed. But in all such cases we
  have to consider in addition the tendency to reversion to progenitors
  more or less remote, and the natural selection of the finest shades of
  difference.</p>

  <p>The nature of the food sometimes either definitely induces certain
  peculiarities, or stands in some close relation with them. Pallas long
  ago asserted that the fat-tailed sheep of Siberia degenerated and lost
  their enormous tails when removed from certain saline pastures; and
  recently <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page280"></a>{280}</span>Erman<a name="NtA_694"
  href="#Nt_694"><sup>[694]</sup></a> states that this occurs with the
  Kirgisian sheep when brought to Orenburgh.</p>

  <p>It is well known that hemp-seed causes bullfinches and certain other
  birds to become black. Mr. Wallace has communicated to me some much more
  remarkable facts of the same nature. The natives of the Amazonian region
  feed the common green parrot (<i>Chrysotis festiva</i>, Linn.) with the
  fat of large Siluroid fishes, and the birds thus treated become
  beautifully variegated with red and yellow feathers. In the Malayan
  archipelago, the natives of Gilolo alter in an analogous manner the
  colours of another parrot, namely, the <i>Lorius garrulus</i>, Linn., and
  thus produce the <i>Lori rajah</i> or King-Lory. These parrots in the
  Malay Islands and South America, when fed by the natives on natural
  vegetable food, such as rice and plantains, retain their proper colours.
  Mr. Wallace has, also, recorded<a name="NtA_695"
  href="#Nt_695"><sup>[695]</sup></a> a still more singular fact. "The
  Indians (of S. America) have a curious art by which they change the
  colours of the feathers of many birds. They pluck out those from the part
  they wish to paint, and inoculate the fresh wound with the milky
  secretion from the skin of a small toad. The feathers grow of a brilliant
  yellow colour, and on being plucked out, it is said, grow again of the
  same colour without any fresh operation."</p>

  <p>Bechstein<a name="NtA_696" href="#Nt_696"><sup>[696]</sup></a> does
  not entertain any doubt that seclusion from light affects, at least
  temporarily, the colours of cage-birds.</p>

  <p>It is well known that the shells of land-mollusca are affected by the
  abundance of lime in different districts. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire<a
  name="NtA_697" href="#Nt_697"><sup>[697]</sup></a> gives the case of
  <i>Helix lactea</i>, which has recently been carried from Spain to the
  South of France and to the Rio Plata, and in both these countries now
  presents a distinct appearance, but whether this has resulted from food
  or climate is not known. With respect to the common oyster, Mr. F.
  Buckland informs me that he can generally distinguish the shells from
  different districts; young oysters brought from Wales and laid down in
  beds where "<i>natives</i>" are indigenous, in the short space of two
  months begin to assume the "native" character. M. Costa<a name="NtA_698"
  href="#Nt_698"><sup>[698]</sup></a> has recorded a much more remarkable
  case of the same nature, namely, that young shells taken from the shores
  of England and placed in the Mediterranean, at once altered their manner
  of growth and formed prominent diverging rays, like those on the shells
  of the proper Mediterranean oyster. The same individual shell, showing
  both forms of growth, was exhibited before a society in Paris. Lastly, it
  is well known that caterpillars fed on different food sometimes either
  themselves acquire a different colour or produce moths different in
  colour.<a name="NtA_699" href="#Nt_699"><sup>[699]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>{281}</span></p>

  <p>It would be travelling beyond my proper limits here to discuss how far
  organic beings in a state of nature are definitely modified by changed
  conditions. In my 'Origin of Species' I have given a brief abstract of
  the facts bearing on this point, and have shown the influence of light on
  the colours of birds, and of residence near the sea on the lurid tints of
  insects, and on the succulency of plants. Mr. Herbert Spencer<a
  name="NtA_700" href="#Nt_700"><sup>[700]</sup></a> has recently discussed
  with much ability this whole subject on broad and general grounds. He
  argues, for instance, that with all animals the external and internal
  tissues are differently acted on by the surrounding conditions, and they
  invariably differ in intimate structure. So again the upper and lower
  surfaces of true leaves, as well as of stems and petioles, when these
  assume the function and occupy the position of leaves, are differently
  circumstanced with respect to light, &amp;c., and apparently in
  consequence differ in structure. But, as Mr. Herbert Spencer admits, it
  is most difficult in all such cases to distinguish between the effects of
  the definite action of physical conditions and the accumulation through
  natural selection of inherited variations which are serviceable to the
  organism, and which have arisen independently of the definite action of
  these conditions.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Although we are not here concerned with organic beings in a state of
  nature, yet I may call attention to one case. Mr. Meehan,<a
  name="NtA_701" href="#Nt_701"><sup>[701]</sup></a> in a remarkable paper,
  compares twenty-nine kinds of American trees, belonging to various
  orders, with their nearest European allies, all grown in close proximity
  in the same garden and under as nearly as possible the same conditions.
  In the American species Mr. Meehan finds, with the rarest exceptions,
  that the leaves fall earlier in the season, and assume before falling a
  brighter tint; that they are less deeply toothed or serrated; that the
  buds are smaller; that the trees are more diffuse in growth and have
  fewer branchlets; and, lastly, that the seeds are smaller&mdash;all in
  comparison with the corresponding European species. Now, considering that
  these trees belong to distinct orders, it is out of the question that the
  peculiarities just specified should have been inherited in the one
  continent from one progenitor, and in the other from another progenitor;
  and considering that the trees inhabit widely different stations, these
  peculiarities can hardly be supposed to be of any special <!-- Page 282
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>{282}</span>service to the
  two series in the Old and New Worlds; therefore these peculiarities
  cannot have been naturally selected. Hence we are led to infer that they
  have been definitely caused by the long-continued action of the different
  climate of the two continents on the trees.</p>

  <p><i>Galls.</i>&mdash;Another class of facts, not relating to cultivated
  plants, deserves attention. I allude to the production of galls. Every
  one knows the curious, bright-red, hairy productions on the wild
  rose-tree, and the various different galls produced by the oak. Some of
  the latter resemble fruit, with one face as rosy as the rosiest apple.
  These bright colours can be of no service either to the gall-forming
  insect or to the tree, and probably are the direct result of the action
  of the light, in the same manner as the apples of Nova Scotia or Canada
  are brighter coloured than English apples. The strongest upholder of the
  doctrine that organic beings are created beautiful to please mankind
  would not, I presume, extend this view to galls. According to Osten
  Sacken's latest revision, no less than fifty-eight kinds of galls are
  produced on the several species of oak, by Cynips with its sub-genera;
  and Mr. B.&nbsp;D. Walsh<a name="NtA_702" href="#Nt_702"><sup>[702]</sup></a>
  states that he can add many others to the list. One American species of
  willow, the <i>Salix humilis</i>, bears ten distinct kinds of galls. The
  leaves which spring from the galls of various English willows differ
  completely in shape from the natural leaves. The young shoots of junipers
  and firs, when punctured by certain insects, yield monstrous growths like
  flowers and cones; and the flowers of some plants become from the same
  cause wholly changed in appearance. Galls are produced in every quarter
  of the world; of several sent to me by Mr. Thwaites from Ceylon, some
  were as symmetrical as a composite flower when in bud, others smooth and
  spherical like a berry; some protected by long spines, others clothed
  with yellow wool formed of long cellular hairs, others with regularly
  tufted hairs. In some galls the internal structure is simple, but in
  others it is highly complex; thus M. Lucaze-Duthiers<a name="NtA_703"
  href="#Nt_703"><sup>[703]</sup></a> has figured in the common ink-gall no
  less than seven concentric layers, composed of distinct tissue, <!-- Page
  283 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>{283}</span>namely,
  the epidermic, sub-epidermic, spongy, intermediate, and the hard
  protective layer formed of curiously thickened woody cells, and, lastly,
  the central mass abounding with starch-granules on which the larvæ
  feed.</p>

  <p>Galls are produced by insects of various orders, but the greater
  number by species of Cynips. It is impossible to read M. Lucaze-Duthier's
  discussion and doubt that the poisonous secretion of the insect causes
  the growth of the gall, and every one knows how virulent is the poison
  secreted by wasps and bees, which belong to the same order with Cynips.
  Galls grow with extraordinary rapidity, and it is said that they attain
  their full size in a few days;<a name="NtA_704"
  href="#Nt_704"><sup>[704]</sup></a> it is certain that they are almost
  completely developed before the larvæ are hatched. Considering that many
  gall-insects are extremely small, the drop of secreted poison must be
  excessively minute; it probably acts on one or two cells alone, which,
  being abnormally stimulated, rapidly increase by a process of
  self-division. Galls, as Mr. Walsh<a name="NtA_705"
  href="#Nt_705"><sup>[705]</sup></a> remarks, afford good, constant, and
  definite characters, each kind keeping as true to form as does any
  independent organic being. This fact becomes still more remarkable when
  we hear that, for instance, seven out of the ten different kinds of galls
  produced on <i>Salix humilis</i> are formed by gall-gnats
  (<i>Cecidomyidæ</i>) which, "though essentially distinct species, yet
  resemble one another so closely that in almost all cases it is difficult,
  and in some cases impossible, to distinguish the full-grown insects one
  from the other."<a name="NtA_706" href="#Nt_706"><sup>[706]</sup></a> For
  in accordance with a wide-spread analogy we may safely infer that the
  poison secreted by insects so closely allied would not differ much in
  nature; yet this slight difference is sufficient to induce widely
  different results. In some few cases the same species of gall-gnat
  produces on distinct species of willows galls which cannot be
  distinguished; the <i>Cynips fecundatrix</i>, also, has been known to
  produce on the Turkish oak, to which it is not properly attached, exactly
  the same kind of gall as on the European oak.<a name="NtA_707"
  href="#Nt_707"><sup>[707]</sup></a> These latter facts apparently prove
  that the nature of the poison is a much more powerful <!-- Page 284
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284"></a>{284}</span>agent in
  determining the form of the gall than the specific character of the tree
  which is acted on.</p>

  <p>As the poisonous secretion of insects belonging to various orders has
  the special power of affecting the growth of various plants;&mdash;as a
  slight difference in the nature of the poison suffices to produce widely
  different results;&mdash;and lastly, as we know that the chemical
  compounds secreted by plants are eminently liable to be modified by
  changed conditions of life, we may believe it possible that various parts
  of a plant might be modified through the agency of its own altered
  secretions. Compare, for instance, the mossy and viscid calyx of a
  moss-rose, which suddenly appears through bud-variation on a
  Provence-rose, with the gall of red moss growing from the inoculated leaf
  of a wild rose, with each filament symmetrically branched like a
  microscopical spruce-fir, bearing a glandular tip and secreting
  odoriferous gummy matter.<a name="NtA_708"
  href="#Nt_708"><sup>[708]</sup></a> Or compare, on the one hand, the
  fruit of the peach, with its hairy skin, fleshy covering, hard shell and
  kernel, and on the other hand one of the more complex galls with its
  epidermic, spongy, and woody layers, surrounding tissue loaded with
  starch granules. These normal and abnormal structures manifestly present
  a certain degree of resemblance. Or, again, reflect on the cases above
  given of parrots which have had their plumage brightly decorated through
  some change in their blood, caused by having been fed on certain fishes,
  or locally inoculated with the poison of a toad. I am far from wishing to
  maintain that the moss-rose or the hard shell of the peach-stone or the
  bright colours of birds are actually due to any chemical change in the
  sap or blood; but these cases of galls and of parrots are excellently
  adapted to show us how powerfully and singularly external agencies may
  affect structure. With such facts before us, we need feel no surprise at
  the appearance of any modification in any organic being.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>I may, also, here allude to the remarkable effects which parasitic
  fungi sometimes produce on plants. Reissek<a name="NtA_709"
  href="#Nt_709"><sup>[709]</sup></a> has described a Thesium, affected by
  an &OElig;cidium, which was greatly modified, and assumed some of the
  <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page285"></a>{285}</span>characteristic features of certain allied
  species, or even genera. Suppose, says Reissek, "the condition originally
  caused by the fungus to become constant in the course of time, the plant
  would, if found growing wild, be considered as a distinct species or even
  as belonging to a new genus." I quote this remark to show how profoundly,
  yet in how natural a manner, this plant must have been modified by the
  parasitic fungus.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Facts and Considerations opposed to the belief that the Conditions
of Life act in a potent manner in causing definite Modifications
of Structure.</i></p>

  <p>I have alluded to the slight differences in species when naturally
  living in distinct countries under different conditions; and such
  differences we feel at first inclined, probably to a limited extent with
  justice, to attribute to the definite action of the surrounding
  conditions. But it must be borne in mind that there are a far greater
  number of animals and plants which range widely and have been exposed to
  great diversities of conditions, yet remain nearly uniform in character.
  Some authors, as previously remarked, account for the varieties of our
  culinary and agricultural plants by the definite action of the conditions
  to which they have been exposed in the different parts of Great Britain;
  but there are about 200 plants<a name="NtA_710"
  href="#Nt_710"><sup>[710]</sup></a> which are found in every single
  English county; these plants must have been exposed for an immense period
  to considerable differences of climate and soil, yet do not differ. So,
  again, some birds, insects, other animals, and plants range over large
  portions of the world, yet retain the same character.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Notwithstanding the facts previously given on the occurrence of highly
  peculiar local diseases and on the strange modifications of structure in
  plants caused by the inoculated poison of insects, and other analogous
  cases; still there are a multitude of variations&mdash;such as the
  modified skull of the niata ox and bulldog, the long horns of Caffre
  cattle, the conjoined toes of the solid-hoofed swine, the immense crest
  and protuberant skull of Polish fowls, the crop of the pouter-pigeon, and
  a host of other such cases&mdash;which we can hardly attribute to the
  definite action, in the sense before specified, of the external
  conditions of life. No doubt in every case there must have been some
  exciting cause; but as we see innumerable individuals exposed to nearly
  the same conditions, and one alone is affected, we may conclude that the
  constitution of the individual is of far higher <!-- Page 286 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>{286}</span>importance than the
  conditions to which it has been exposed. It seems, indeed, to be a
  general rule that conspicuous variations occur rarely, and in one
  individual alone out of many thousands, though all may have been exposed,
  as far as we can judge, to nearly the same conditions. As the most
  strongly marked variations graduate insensibly into the most trifling, we
  are led by the same train of thought to attribute each slight variation
  much more to innate differences of constitution, however caused, than to
  the definite action of the surrounding conditions.</p>

  <p>We are led to the same conclusion by considering the cases, formerly
  alluded to, of fowls and pigeons, which have varied and will no doubt go
  on varying in directly opposite ways, though kept during many generations
  under nearly the same conditions. Some, for instance, are born with their
  beaks, wings, tails, legs, &amp;c., a little longer, and others with
  these same parts a little shorter. By the long-continued selection of
  such slight individual differences, which occur in birds kept in the same
  aviary, widely different races could certainly be formed; and
  long-continued selection, important as is the result, does nothing but
  preserve the variations which appear to us to arise spontaneously.</p>

  <p>In these cases we see that domesticated animals vary in an indefinite
  number of particulars, though treated as uniformly as is possible. On the
  other hand, there are instances of animals and plants, which, though
  exposed to very different conditions, both under nature and
  domestication, have varied in nearly the same manner. Mr. Layard informs
  me that he has observed amongst the Caffres of South Africa a dog
  singularly like an arctic Esquimaux dog. Pigeons in India present nearly
  the same wide diversities of colour as in Europe; and I have seen
  chequered and simply barred pigeons, and pigeons with blue and white
  loins, from Sierra Leone, Madeira, England, and India. New varieties of
  flowers are continually raised in different parts of Great Britain, but
  many of these are found by the judges at our exhibitions to be almost
  identical with old varieties. A vast number of new fruit-trees and
  culinary vegetables have been produced in North America: these differ
  from European varieties in the same general manner as the several
  varieties raised in Europe differ from each other; and no one has ever
  pretended that the climate of America has given to the many American
  varieties any general character by which they can be recognised.
  Nevertheless, from the facts previously advanced on the authority of Mr.
  Meehan with respect to American and European forest-trees, it would be
  rash to affirm that varieties raised in the two countries would not in
  the course of ages assume a distinctive character. Mr. Masters has
  recorded a striking fact<a name="NtA_711"
  href="#Nt_711"><sup>[711]</sup></a> bearing on this subject: he raised
  numerous plants of <i>Hybiscus Syriacus</i> from seed collected in South
  Carolina and the Holy Land, where the parent-plants must have been
  exposed to considerably different conditions; yet the seedlings from both
  localities broke into two similar strains, one with obtuse leaves and
  purple or crimson flowers, and the other with elongated leaves and more
  or less pink flowers.</p>

<p><!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287"></a>{287}</span></p>

  <p>We may, also, infer the prepotent influence of the constitution of the
  organism over the definite action of the conditions of life, from the
  several cases given in the earlier chapters of parallel series of
  varieties,&mdash;an important subject, hereafter to be more fully
  discussed. Sub-varieties of the several kinds of wheat, gourds, peaches,
  and other plants, and to a certain limited extent sub-varieties of the
  fowl, pigeon, and dog, have been shown either to resemble or to differ
  from each other in a closely corresponding and parallel manner. In other
  cases, a variety of one species resembles a distinct species; or the
  varieties of two distinct species resemble each other. Although these
  parallel resemblances no doubt often result from reversion to the former
  characters of a common progenitor; yet in other cases, when new
  characters first appear, the resemblance must be attributed to the
  inheritance of a similar constitution, and consequently to a tendency to
  vary in the same manner. We see something of a similar kind in the same
  monstrosity appearing and reappearing many times in the same animal, and,
  as Dr. Maxwell Masters has remarked to me, in the same plant.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We may at least conclude thus far, that the amount of modification
  which animals and plants have undergone under domestication, does not
  correspond with the degree to which they have been subjected to changed
  circumstances. As we know the parentage of domesticated birds far better
  than of most quadrupeds, we will glance through the list. The pigeon has
  varied in Europe more than almost any other bird; yet it is a native
  species, and has not been exposed to any extraordinary change of
  conditions. The fowl has varied equally, or almost equally, with the
  pigeon, and is a native of the hot jungles of India. Neither the peacock,
  a native of the same country, nor the guinea-fowl, an inhabitant of the
  dry deserts of Africa, has varied at all, or only in colour. The turkey,
  from Mexico, has varied but little. The duck, on the other hand, a native
  of Europe, has yielded some well-marked races; and as this is an aquatic
  bird, it must have been subjected to a far more serious change in its
  habits than the pigeon or even the fowl, which nevertheless have varied
  in a much higher degree. The goose, a native of Europe and aquatic like
  the duck, has varied less than any other domesticated bird, except the
  peacock.</p>

  <p>Bud-variation is, also, important under our present point of view. In
  some few cases, as when all the eyes or buds on the same tuber of the
  potato, or all the fruit on the same plum-tree, or all the flowers on the
  same plant, have suddenly varied in the same manner, it might be argued
  that the <!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page288"></a>{288}</span>variation had been definitely caused by
  some change in the conditions to which the plants had been exposed; yet,
  in other cases, such an admission is extremely difficult. As new
  characters sometimes appear by bud-variation, which do not occur in the
  parent-species or in any allied species, we may reject, at least in these
  cases, the idea that they are due to reversion. Now it is well worth
  while to reflect maturely on some striking case of bud-variation, for
  instance that of the peach. This tree has been cultivated by the million
  in various parts of the world, has been treated differently, grown on its
  own roots and grafted on various stocks, planted as a standard, against a
  wall, and under glass; yet each bud of each sub-variety keeps true to its
  kind. But occasionally, at long intervals of time, a tree in England, or
  under the widely-different climate of Virginia, produces a single bud,
  and this yields a branch which ever afterwards bears nectarines.
  Nectarines differ, as every one knows, from peaches in their smoothness,
  size, and flavour; and the difference is so great, that some botanists
  have maintained that they are specifically distinct. So permanent are the
  characters thus suddenly acquired, that a nectarine produced by
  bud-variation has propagated itself by seed. To guard against the
  supposition that there is some fundamental distinction between bud and
  seminal variation, it is well to bear in mind that nectarines have
  likewise been produced from the stone of the peach; and, reversely,
  peaches from the stone of the nectarine. Now is it possible to conceive
  external conditions more closely alike than those to which the buds on
  the same tree are exposed? Yet one bud alone, out of the many thousands
  borne by the same tree, has suddenly without any apparent cause produced
  a nectarine. But the case is even stronger than this, for the same
  flower-bud has yielded a fruit, one-half or one-quarter a nectarine, and
  the other half or three-quarters a peach. Again, seven or eight varieties
  of the peach have yielded by bud-variation nectarines: the nectarines
  thus produced, no doubt, differ a little from each other; but still they
  are nectarines. Of course there must be some cause, internal or external,
  to excite the peach-bud to change its nature; but I cannot imagine a
  class of facts better adapted to force on our minds the conviction that
  what we call the external conditions of life are quite insignificant in
  <!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page289"></a>{289}</span>relation to any particular variation, in
  comparison with the organisation or constitution of the being which
  varies.</p>

  <p>It is known from the labours of Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and recently
  from those of Dareste and others, that eggs of the fowl, if shaken,
  placed upright, perforated, covered in part with varnish, &amp;c.,
  produce monstrous chickens. Now these monstrosities may be said to be
  directly caused by such unnatural conditions, but the modifications thus
  induced are not of a definite nature. An excellent observer, M. Camille
  Dareste,<a name="NtA_712" href="#Nt_712"><sup>[712]</sup></a> remarks
  "that the various species of monstrosities are not determined by specific
  causes; the external agencies which modify the development of the embryo
  act solely in causing a perturbation&mdash;a perversion in the normal
  course of development." He compares the result to what we see in illness:
  a sudden chill, for instance, affects one individual alone out of many,
  causing either a cold, or sore-throat, rheumatism, or inflammation of the
  lungs or pleura. Contagious matter acts in an analogous manner.<a
  name="NtA_713" href="#Nt_713"><sup>[713]</sup></a> We may take a still
  more specific instance: seven pigeons were struck by rattle-snakes;<a
  name="NtA_714" href="#Nt_714"><sup>[714]</sup></a> some suffered from
  convulsions; some had their blood coagulated, in others it was perfectly
  fluid; some showed ecchymosed spots on the heart, others on the
  intestines, &amp;c.; others again showed no visible lesion in any organ.
  It is well known that excess in drinking causes different diseases in
  different men; but men living under a cold and tropical climate are
  differently affected:<a name="NtA_715"
  href="#Nt_715"><sup>[715]</sup></a> and in this case we see the definite
  influence of opposite conditions. The foregoing facts apparently give us
  as good an idea as we are likely for a long time to obtain, how in many
  cases external conditions act directly, though not definitely, in causing
  modifications of structure.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Summary.</i>&mdash;There can be no doubt, from the facts given in
  the early part of this chapter, that extremely slight changes in <!--
  Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"></a>{290}</span>the
  conditions of life sometimes act in a definite manner on our already
  variable domesticated productions; and, as the action of changed
  conditions in causing general or indefinite variability is accumulative,
  so it may be with their definite action. Hence it is possible that great
  and definite modifications of structure may result from altered
  conditions acting during a long series of generations. In some few
  instances a marked effect has been produced quickly on all, or nearly
  all, the individuals which have been exposed to some considerable change
  of climate, food, or other circumstance. This has occurred, and is now
  occurring, with European men in the United States, with European dogs in
  India, with horses in the Falkland Islands, apparently with various
  animals at Angora, with foreign oysters in the Mediterranean, and with
  maize grown in Europe from tropical seed. We have seen that the chemical
  compounds secreted by plants and the state of their tissues are readily
  affected by changed conditions. In some cases a relation apparently
  exists between certain characters and certain conditions, so that if the
  latter be changed the character is lost&mdash;as with cultivated flowers,
  with some few culinary plants, with the fruit of the melon, with
  fat-tailed sheep, and other sheep having peculiar fleeces.</p>

  <p>The production of galls, and the change of plumage in parrots when fed
  on peculiar food or when inoculated by the poison of a toad, prove to us
  what great and mysterious changes in structure and colour may be the
  definite result of chemical changes in the nutrient fluids or
  tissues.</p>

  <p>We have also reason to believe that organic beings in a state of
  nature may be modified in various definite ways by the conditions to
  which they have been long exposed, as in the case of American trees in
  comparison with their representatives in Europe. But in all such cases it
  is most difficult to distinguish between the definite results of changed
  conditions, and the accumulation through natural selection of serviceable
  variations which have arisen independently of the nature of the
  conditions. If, for instance, a plant had to be modified so as to become
  fitted to inhabit a humid instead of an arid station, we have no reason
  to believe that variations of the right kind would occur more frequently
  if the parent-plant inhabited a station a little more <!-- Page 291
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291"></a>{291}</span>humid than
  usual. Whether the station was unusually dry or humid, variations
  adapting the plant in a slight degree for directly opposite habits of
  life would occasionally arise, as we have reason to believe from what we
  know in other cases.</p>

  <p>In most, perhaps in all cases, the organisation or constitution of the
  being which is acted on, is a much more important element than the nature
  of the changed conditions, in determining the nature of the variation. We
  have evidence of this in the appearance of nearly similar modifications
  under different conditions, and of different modifications under
  apparently nearly the same conditions. We have still better evidence of
  this in closely parallel varieties being frequently produced from
  distinct races, or even distinct species, and in the frequent recurrence
  of the same monstrosity in the same species. We have also seen that the
  degree to which domesticated birds have varied, does not stand in any
  close relation with the amount of change to which they have been
  subjected.</p>

  <p>To recur once again to bud-variations. When we reflect on the millions
  of buds which many trees have produced, before some one bud has varied,
  we are lost in wonder what the precise cause of each variation can be.
  Let us recall the case given by Andrew Knight of the forty-year-old tree
  of the yellow magnum bonum plum, an old variety which has been propagated
  by grafts on various stocks for a very long period throughout Europe and
  North America, and on which a single bud suddenly produced the red magnum
  bonum. We should also bear in mind that distinct varieties, and even
  distinct species,&mdash;as in the case of peaches, nectarines, and
  apricots,&mdash;of certain roses and camellias,&mdash;although separated
  by a vast number of generations from any progenitor in common, and
  although cultivated under diversified conditions, have yielded by
  bud-variation closely analogous varieties. When we reflect on these facts
  we become deeply impressed with the conviction that in such cases the
  nature of the variation depends but little on the conditions to which the
  plant has been exposed, and not in any especial manner on its individual
  character, but much more on the general nature or constitution, inherited
  from some remote progenitor, of the whole group of allied beings to which
  the plant belongs. We are thus driven to conclude that in most <!-- Page
  292 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>{292}</span>cases the
  conditions of life play a subordinate part in causing any particular
  modification; like that which a spark plays, when a mass of combustibles
  bursts into flame&mdash;the nature of the flame depending on the
  combustible matter, and not on the spark.</p>

  <p>No doubt each slight variation must have its efficient cause; but it
  is as hopeless an attempt to discover the cause of each as to say why a
  chill or a poison affects one man differently from another. Even with
  modifications resulting from the definite action of the conditions of
  life, when all or nearly all the individuals, which have been similarly
  exposed, are similarly affected, we can rarely see the precise relation
  between cause and effect. In the next chapter it will be shown that the
  increased use or disuse of various organs, produces an inherited effect.
  It will further be seen that certain variations are bound together by
  correlation and other laws. Beyond this we cannot at present explain
  either the causes or manner of action of Variation.</p>

  <p>Finally, as indefinite and almost illimitable variability is the usual
  result of domestication and cultivation, with the same part or organ
  varying in different individuals in different or even in directly
  opposite ways; and as the same variation, if strongly pronounced, usually
  recurs only after long intervals of time, any particular variation would
  generally be lost by crossing, reversion, and the accidental destruction
  of the varying individuals, unless carefully preserved by man. Hence,
  although it must be admitted that new conditions of life do sometimes
  definitely affect organic beings, it may be doubted whether well-marked
  races have often been produced by the direct action of changed conditions
  without the aid of selection either by man or nature.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In this and the two following chapters I shall discuss, as well as the
  difficulty of the subject permits, the several laws which govern
  Variability. These may be grouped under the effects of use and disuse,
  including changed habits and acclimatisation&mdash;arrests of
  development&mdash;correlated variation&mdash;the cohesion of homologous
  parts&mdash;the variability of multiple parts&mdash;compensation of
  growth&mdash;the position of buds with respect to the axis of the
  plant&mdash;and lastly, analogous variation. These several subjects so
  graduate into each other that their distinction is often arbitrary.</p>

  <p>It may be convenient first briefly to discuss that co-ordinating and
  reparative power which is common, in a higher or lower degree, to all
  organic beings, and which was formerly designated by physiologists as the
  <i>nisus formativus</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Blumenbach and others<a name="NtA_716"
  href="#Nt_716"><sup>[716]</sup></a> have insisted that the principle
  which permits a Hydra, when cut into fragments, to develop itself into
  two or more perfect animals, is the same with that which causes a wound
  in the higher animals to heal by a cicatrice. Such cases as that of the
  Hydra are evidently analogous with the spontaneous division or
  fissiparous generation of the lowest animals, and likewise with the
  budding of plants. Between these extreme cases and that of a mere
  cicatrice we have every gradation. Spallanzani,<a name="NtA_717"
  href="#Nt_717"><sup>[717]</sup></a> by cutting off the legs and tail of a
  Salamander, got in the course of three months six crops of these members;
  so that 687 perfect bones were reproduced by one animal during one
  season. At whatever <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page294"></a>{294}</span>point the limb was cut off, the deficient
  part, and no more, was exactly reproduced. Even with man, as we have seen
  in the twelfth chapter, when treating of polydactylism, the entire limb
  whilst in an embryonic state, and supernumerary digits, are occasionally,
  though imperfectly, reproduced after amputation. When a diseased bone has
  been removed, a new one sometimes "gradually assumes the regular form,
  and all the attachments of muscles, ligaments, &amp;c., become as
  complete as before."<a name="NtA_718"
  href="#Nt_718"><sup>[718]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This power of regrowth does not, however, always act perfectly: the
  reproduced tail of a lizard differs in the forms of the scales from the
  normal tail: with certain Orthopterous insects the large hind legs are
  reproduced of smaller size:<a name="NtA_719"
  href="#Nt_719"><sup>[719]</sup></a> the white cicatrice which in the
  higher animals unites the edges of a deep wound is not formed of perfect
  skin, for elastic tissue is not produced till long afterwards.<a
  name="NtA_720" href="#Nt_720"><sup>[720]</sup></a> "The activity of the
  <i>nisus formativus</i>," says Blumenbach, "is in an inverse ratio to the
  age of the organised body." To this may be added that its power is
  greater in animals the lower they are in the scale of organisation; and
  animals low in the scale correspond with the embryos of higher animals
  belonging to the same class. Newport's observations<a name="NtA_721"
  href="#Nt_721"><sup>[721]</sup></a> afford a good illustration of this
  fact, for he found that "myriapods, whose highest development scarcely
  carries them beyond the larvæ of perfect insects, can regenerate limbs
  and antennæ up to the time of their last moult;" and so can the larvæ of
  true insects, but not the mature insect. Salamanders correspond in
  development with the tadpoles or larvæ of the tailless Batrachians, and
  both possess to a large extent the power of regrowth; but not so the
  mature tailless Batrachians.</p>

  <p>Absorption often plays an important part in the repairs of injuries.
  When a bone is broken, and does not unite, the ends are absorbed and
  rounded, so that a false joint is formed; or if the ends unite, but
  overlap, the projecting parts are removed.<a name="NtA_722"
  href="#Nt_722"><sup>[722]</sup></a> But absorption comes into action, as
  Virchow remarks, during the normal growth of bones; parts which are solid
  during youth become hollowed out for the medullary tissue as the bone
  increases in size. In trying to understand the many well-adapted cases of
  regrowth when aided by absorption, we should remember that most parts of
  the organisation, even whilst retaining the same form, undergo constant
  renewal; so that a part which was not renewed would naturally be liable
  to complete <span class="correction" title="Original reads `absortion'."
  >absorption</span>.</p>

  <p>Some cases, usually classed under the so-called <i>nisus
  formativus</i>, at first appear to come under a distinct head; for not
  only are old structures reproduced, but structures which appear new are
  formed. Thus, after inflammation "false membranes," furnished with
  blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, are developed; or a f&oelig;tus
  escapes from the Fallopian tubes, and falls into the abdomen, "nature
  pours out a quantity of plastic lymph, which forms itself into organised
  membrane, richly supplied with blood-vessels," and the f&oelig;tus is
  nourished for a time. In certain cases of <!-- Page 295 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page295"></a>{295}</span>hydrocephalus the open
  and dangerous spaces in the skull are filled up with new bones, which
  interlock by perfect serrated sutures.<a name="NtA_723"
  href="#Nt_723"><sup>[723]</sup></a> But most physiologists, especially on
  the Continent, have now given up the belief in plastic lymph or blastema,
  and Virchow<a name="NtA_724" href="#Nt_724"><sup>[724]</sup></a>
  maintains that every structure, new or old, is formed by the
  proliferation of pre-existing cells. On this view false membranes, like
  cancerous or other tumours, are merely abnormal developments of normal
  growths; and we can thus understand how it is that they resemble
  adjoining structures; for instance, that "false membrane in the serous
  cavities acquires a covering of epithelium exactly like that which covers
  the original serous membrane; adhesions of the iris may become black
  apparently from the production of pigment-cells like those of the
  uvea."<a name="NtA_725" href="#Nt_725"><sup>[725]</sup></a></p>

  <p>No doubt the power of reparation, though not always quite perfect, is
  an admirable provision, ready for various emergencies, even for those
  which occur only at long intervals of time.<a name="NtA_726"
  href="#Nt_726"><sup>[726]</sup></a> Yet this power is not more wonderful
  than the growth and development of every single creature, more especially
  of those which are propagated by fissiparous generation. This subject has
  been here noticed, because we may infer that, when any part or organ is
  either greatly increased in size or wholly suppressed through variation
  and continued selection, the co-ordinating power of the organisation will
  continually tend to bring all the parts again into harmony with each
  other.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>On the Effects of the Increased Use and Disuse of Organs.</i></p>

  <p>It is notorious, and we shall immediately adduce proofs, that
  increased use or action strengthens muscles, glands, sense-organs,
  &amp;c.; and that disuse, on the other hand, weakens them. I have not met
  with any clear explanation of this fact in works on Physiology. Mr.
  Herbert Spencer<a name="NtA_727" href="#Nt_727"><sup>[727]</sup></a>
  maintains that when muscles are much used, or when intermittent pressure
  is applied to the epidermis, an excess of nutritive matter exudes from
  the vessels, and that this gives additional development to the adjoining
  parts. That an increased flow of blood towards an organ leads to its
  greater development is probable, if not certain. Mr. Paget<a
  name="NtA_728" href="#Nt_728"><sup>[728]</sup></a> thus accounts for the
  long, thick, and dark-coloured hair which occasionally grows, even in
  young children, near old-standing inflamed surfaces or fractured bones.
  When Hunter <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page296"></a>{296}</span>inserted the spur of a cock into the comb,
  which is well supplied with blood-vessels, it grew in one case in a
  spiral direction to a length of six inches, and in another case forward,
  like a horn, so that the bird could not touch the ground with its beak.
  But whether Mr. Herbert Spencer's view of the exudation of nutritive
  matter due to increased movement and pressure, will fully account for the
  augmented size of bones, ligaments, and especially of internal glands and
  nerves, seems doubtful. According to the interesting observations of M.
  Sedillot,<a name="NtA_729" href="#Nt_729"><sup>[729]</sup></a> when a
  portion of one bone of the leg or fore-arm of an animal is removed and is
  not replaced by growth, the associated bone enlarges till it attains a
  bulk equal to that of the two bones, of which it has to perform the
  functions. This is best exhibited in dogs in which the tibia has been
  removed; the companion bone, which is naturally almost filiform and not
  one-fifth the size of the other, soon acquires a size equal to or greater
  than the tibia. Now, it is at first difficult to believe that increased
  weight acting on a straight bone could, by alternately increased and
  diminished pressure, cause nutritive matter to exude from the vessels
  which permeate the periosteum. Nevertheless, the observations adduced by
  Mr. Spencer,<a name="NtA_730" href="#Nt_730"><sup>[730]</sup></a> on the
  strengthening of the bowed bones of rickety children, along their concave
  sides, leads to the belief that this is possible.</p>

  <p>Mr. H. Spencer has also shown that the ascent of the sap in trees is
  aided by the rocking movement caused by the wind; and the sap strengthens
  the trunk "in proportion to the stress to be borne; since the more severe
  and the more repeated the strains, the greater must be the exudation from
  the vessels into the surrounding tissue, and the greater the thickening
  of this tissue by secondary deposits."<a name="NtA_731"
  href="#Nt_731"><sup>[731]</sup></a> But woody trunks may be formed of
  hard tissue without their having been subjected to any movement, as we
  see with ivy closely attached to old walls. In all these cases, it is
  very difficult to disentangle the effects of long-continued selection
  from those consequent on the increased action or movement of the part.
  Mr. H. Spencer<a name="NtA_732" href="#Nt_732"><sup>[732]</sup></a>
  acknowledges this difficulty, and gives as an instance the spines <!--
  Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>{297}</span>or
  thorns of trees, and the shells of nuts. Here we have extremely hard
  woody tissue without the possibility of any movement to cause exudation,
  and without, as far as we can see, any other directly exciting cause; and
  as the hardness of these parts is of manifest service to the plant, we
  may look at the result as probably due to the selection of so-called
  spontaneous variations. Every one knows that hard work thickens the
  epidermis on the hands; and when we hear that with infants long before
  their birth the epidermis is thicker on the palms and soles of the feet
  than on any other part of the body, as was observed with admiration by
  Albinus,<a name="NtA_733" href="#Nt_733"><sup>[733]</sup></a> we are
  naturally inclined to attribute this to the inherited effects of
  long-continued use or pressure. We are tempted to extend the same view
  even to the hoofs of quadrupeds; but who will pretend to determine how
  far natural selection may have aided in the formation of structures of
  such obvious importance to the animal?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>That use strengthens the muscles may be seen in the limbs of artisans
  who follow different trades; and when a muscle is strengthened, the
  tendons, and the crests of bone to which they are attached, become
  enlarged; and this must likewise be the case with the blood-vessels and
  nerves. On the other hand, when a limb is not used, as by Eastern
  fanatics, or when the nerve supplying it with nervous power is
  effectually destroyed, the muscles wither. So again, when the eye is
  destroyed the optic nerve becomes atrophied, sometimes even in the course
  of a few months.<a name="NtA_734" href="#Nt_734"><sup>[734]</sup></a> The
  Proteus is furnished with branchiæ as well as with lungs: and
  Schreibers<a name="NtA_735" href="#Nt_735"><sup>[735]</sup></a> found
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads `than'.">that</span> when
  the animal was compelled to live in deep water the branchiæ were
  developed to thrice their ordinary size, and the lungs were partially
  atrophied. When, on the other hand, the animal was compelled to live in
  shallow water, the lungs became larger and more vascular, whilst the
  branchiæ disappeared in a more or less complete degree. Such
  modifications as these are, however, of comparatively little value for
  us, as we do not actually know that they tend to be inherited.</p>

  <p>In many cases there is reason to believe that the lessened use of
  various organs has affected the corresponding parts in the offspring. But
  there is no good evidence that this ever follows in the course of a
  single generation. It appears, as in the case of general or indefinite
  variability, that several generations must be subjected to changed habits
  for any appreciable result. Our domestic fowls, ducks, and geese have
  almost lost, not <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page298"></a>{298}</span>only in the individual but in the race,
  their power of flight; for we do not see a chicken, when frightened, take
  flight like a young pheasant. Hence I was led carefully to compare the
  limb-bones of fowls, ducks, pigeons, and rabbits, with the same bones in
  the wild parent-species. As the measurements and weights were fully given
  in the earlier chapters, I need here only recapitulate the results. With
  domestic pigeons, the length of the sternum, the prominence of its crest,
  the length of the scapulæ and furcula, the length of the wings as
  measured from tip to tip of the radius, are all reduced relatively to the
  same parts in the wild pigeon. The wing and tail feathers, however, are
  increased in length, but this may have as little connection with the use
  of the wings or tail, as the lengthened hair on a dog with the amount of
  exercise which the breed has habitually taken. The feet of pigeons,
  except in the long-beaked races, are reduced in size. With fowls the
  crest of the sternum is less prominent, and is often distorted or
  monstrous; the wing-bones have become lighter relatively to the
  leg-bones, and are apparently a little shorter in comparison with those
  of the parent-form, the <i>Gallus bankiva</i>. With ducks, the crest of
  the sternum is affected in the same manner as in the foregoing cases: the
  furcula, coracoids, and scapulæ are all reduced in weight relatively to
  the whole skeleton: the bones of the wings are shorter and lighter, and
  the bones of the legs longer and heavier, relatively to each other, and
  relatively to the whole skeleton, in comparison with the same bones in
  the wild-duck. The decreased weight and size of the bones, in the
  foregoing cases, is probably the indirect result of the reaction of the
  weakened muscles on the bones. I failed to compare the feathers of the
  wings of the tame and wild duck; but Gloger<a name="NtA_736"
  href="#Nt_736"><sup>[736]</sup></a> asserts that in the wild duck the
  tips of the wing-feathers reach almost to the end of the tail, whilst in
  the domestic duck they often hardly reach to its base. He remarks, also,
  on the greater thickness of the legs, and says that the swimming membrane
  between the toes is reduced; but I was not able to detect this latter
  difference.</p>

  <p>With the domesticated rabbit the body, together with the whole
  skeleton, is generally larger and heavier than in the wild animal, and
  the leg-bones are heavier in due proportion; but whatever standard of
  comparison be taken, neither the leg-bones nor the scapulæ have increased
  in length proportionally with the increased dimensions of the rest of the
  skeleton. The skull has become in a marked manner narrower, and, from the
  measurements of its capacity formerly given, we may conclude, that this
  narrowness results from the decreased size of the brain, consequent on
  the mentally inactive life led by these closely-confined animals.</p>

  <p>We have seen in the eighth chapter that silk-moths, which have been
  kept during many centuries closely confined, emerge from their cocoons
  with their wings distorted, incapable of flight, often greatly reduced in
  size, or even, according to Quatrefages, quite rudimentary. This
  condition of the wings may be largely owing to the same kind of
  monstrosity which often affects wild Lepidoptera when artificially reared
  from the cocoon; or it may <!-- Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page299"></a>{299}</span>be in part due to an inherent tendency,
  which is common to the females of many Bombycidæ, to have their wings in
  a more or less rudimentary state; but part of the effect may probably be
  attributed to long-continued disuse.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From the foregoing facts there can be no doubt that certain parts of
  the skeleton in our anciently domesticated animals, have been modified in
  length and weight by the effects of decreased or increased use; but they
  have not been modified, as shown in the earlier chapters, in shape or
  structure. We must, however, be cautious in extending this latter
  conclusion to animals living a free life; for these will occasionally be
  exposed during successive generations to the severest competition. With
  wild animals it would be an advantage in the struggle for life that every
  superfluous and useless detail of structure should be removed or
  absorbed; and thus the reduced bones might ultimately become changed in
  structure. With highly-fed domesticated animals, on the other hand, there
  is no economy of growth; nor any tendency to the elimination of trifling
  and superfluous details of structure.</p>

  <p>Turning now to more general observations, Nathusius has shown that,
  with the improved races of the pig, the shortened legs and snout, the
  form of the articular condyles of the occiput, and the position of the
  jaws with the upper canine teeth projecting in a most anomalous manner in
  front of the lower canines, may be attributed to these parts not having
  been fully exercised. For the highly-cultivated races do not travel in
  search of food, nor root up the ground with their ringed muzzles. These
  modifications of structure, which are all strictly inherited,
  characterise several improved breeds, so that they cannot have been
  derived from any single domestic or wild stock.<a name="NtA_737"
  href="#Nt_737"><sup>[737]</sup></a> With respect to cattle, Professor
  Tanner has remarked that the lungs and liver in the improved breeds "are
  found to be considerably reduced in size when compared with those
  possessed by animals having perfect liberty;"<a name="NtA_738"
  href="#Nt_738"><sup>[738]</sup></a> and the reduction of these organs
  affects the general shape of the body. The cause of the reduced lungs in
  highly-bred animals which take little exercise is <!-- Page 300 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>{300}</span>obvious; and perhaps
  the liver may be affected by the nutritious and artificial food on which
  they largely subsist.</p>

  <p>It is well known that, when an artery is tied, the <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `anastomising', corrected by errata, page viii."
  >anastomosing</span> branches, from being forced to transmit more blood,
  increase in diameter; and this increase cannot be accounted for by mere
  extension, as their coats gain in strength. Mr. Herbert Spencer<a
  name="NtA_739" href="#Nt_739"><sup>[739]</sup></a> has argued that with
  plants the flow of sap from the point of supply to the growing part first
  elongates the cells in this line; and that the cells then become
  confluent, thus forming the ducts; so that, on this view, the vessels in
  plants are formed by the mutual reaction of the flowing sap and cellular
  tissue. Dr. W. Turner has remarked,<a name="NtA_740"
  href="#Nt_740"><sup>[740]</sup></a> with respect to the branches of
  arteries, and likewise to a certain extent with nerves, that the great
  principle of compensation frequently comes into play; for "when two
  nerves pass to adjacent cutaneous areas, an inverse relation as regards
  size may subsist between them; a deficiency in one may be supplied by an
  increase in the other, and thus the area of the former may be trespassed
  on by the latter nerve." But how far in these cases the difference in
  size in the nerves and arteries is due to original variation, and how far
  to increased use or action, is not clear.</p>

  <p>In reference to glands, Mr. Paget observes that "when one kidney is
  destroyed the other often becomes much larger, and does double work."<a
  name="NtA_741" href="#Nt_741"><sup>[741]</sup></a> If we compare the size
  of the udders and their power of secretion in cows which have been long
  domesticated, and in certain goats in which the udders nearly touch the
  ground, with the size and power of secretion of these organs in wild or
  half-domesticated animals, the difference is great. A good cow with us
  daily yields more than five gallons, or forty pints of milk, whilst a
  first-rate animal, kept, for instance, by the Damaras of South Africa,<a
  name="NtA_742" href="#Nt_742"><sup>[742]</sup></a> "rarely gives more
  than two or three pints of milk daily, and, should her calf be taken from
  her, she absolutely refuses to give any." We may attribute the excellence
  of our cows, and of certain goats, partly to the continued selection of
  the best milking animals, and partly to the inherited effects of the
  increased action, through man's art, of the secreting glands.</p>

  <p>It is notorious, as was remarked in the twelfth chapter, that
  short-sight is inherited; and if we compare watchmakers or engravers
  with, for instance, sailors, we can hardly doubt that vision continually

  eye.</p>

  <p>Veterinarians are unanimous that horses become affected with spavins,
  splints, ringbones, &amp;c., from being shod, and from travelling on hard
  roads, and they are almost equally unanimous that these injuries are

  <p>Our domesticated quadrupeds are all descended, as far as is known,
  from species having erect ears; yet few kinds can be named, of which at
  least one race has not drooping ears. Cats in China, horses in parts of
  Russia, sheep in Italy and elsewhere, the guinea-pig in Germany, goats
  and cattle in India, rabbits, pigs, and dogs in all long-civilised
  countries, have dependent ears. With wild animals, which constantly use
  their ears like funnels to catch every passing sound, and especially to
  ascertain the direction whence it comes, there is not, as Mr. Blyth has
  remarked, any species with drooping ears except the elephant. Hence the
  incapacity to erect the ears is certainly in some manner the result of
  domestication; and this incapacity has been attributed by various
  authors<a name="NtA_744" href="#Nt_744"><sup>[744]</sup></a> to disuse,
  for animals protected by man are not compelled habitually to use their
  ears. Col. Hamilton Smith<a name="NtA_745"
  href="#Nt_745"><sup>[745]</sup></a> states that in ancient effigies of
  the dog, "with the exception of one Egyptian instance, no sculpture of
  the earlier Grecian era produces representations of hounds with
  completely drooping ears; those with them half pendulous are missing in
  the most ancient; and this character increases, by degrees, in the works
  of the Roman period." Godron also has remarked that "the pigs of the
  ancient Egyptians had not their ears enlarged and pendent."<a
  name="NtA_746" href="#Nt_746"><sup>[746]</sup></a> But it is remarkable
  that the drooping of the ears, though probably the effect of disuse, is
  not accompanied by any decrease in size; on the contrary, when we
  remember that animals so different as fancy rabbits, certain Indian
  breeds of the goat, our petted spaniels, bloodhounds, and other dogs,
  have enormously elongated ears, it would appear as if disuse actually
  caused an increase in length. With rabbits, the drooping of the much
  elongated ears has affected even the structure of the skull.</p>

  <p>The tail of no wild animal, as remarked to me by Mr. Blyth, is curled;
  whereas pigs and some races of dogs have their tails much curled. This
  deformity, therefore, appears to be the result of domestication, but
  whether in any way connected with the lessened use of the tail is
  doubtful.</p>

<p><!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>{302}</span></p>

  <p>The epidermis on our hands is easily thickened, as every one knows, by
  hard work. In a district of Ceylon the sheep have "horny callosities that
  defend their knees, and which arise from their habit of kneeling down to
  crop the short herbage, and this distinguishes the Jaffna flocks from
  those of other portions of the island;" but it is not stated whether this
  peculiarity is inherited.<a name="NtA_747"
  href="#Nt_747"><sup>[747]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The mucous membrane which lines the stomach is continuous with the
  external skin of the body; therefore it is not surprising that its
  texture should be affected by the nature of the food consumed, but other
  and more interesting changes likewise follow. Hunter long ago observed
  that the muscular coat of the stomach of a gull (<i>Larus
  tridactylus</i>) which had been fed for a year chiefly on grain was
  thickened; and, according to Dr. Edmondston, a similar change
  periodically occurs in the Shetland Islands in the stomach of the
  <i>Larus argentatus</i>, which in the spring frequents the corn-fields
  and feeds on the seed. The same careful observer has noticed a great
  change in the stomach of a raven which had been long fed on vegetable
  food. In the case of an owl (<i>Strix grallaria</i>) similarly treated,
  Menetries states that the form of the stomach was changed, the inner coat
  became leathery, and the liver increased in size. Whether these
  modifications in the digestive organs would in the course of generations
  become inherited is not known.<a name="NtA_748"
  href="#Nt_748"><sup>[748]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The increased or diminished length of the intestines, which apparently
  results from changed diet, is a more remarkable case, because it is
  characteristic of certain animals in their domesticated condition, and
  therefore must be inherited. The complex absorbent system, the
  blood-vessels, nerves, and muscles, are necessarily all modified together
  with the intestines. According to Daubenton, the intestines of the
  domestic cat are one-third longer than those of the wild cat of Europe;
  and although this species is not the parent-stock of the domestic animal,
  yet, as Isidore Geoffroy has remarked, the several species <!-- Page 303
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>{303}</span>of cats are so
  closely allied that the comparison is probably a fair one. The increased
  length appears to be due to the domestic cat being less strictly
  carnivorous in its diet than any wild feline species; I have seen a
  French kitten eating vegetables as readily as meat. According to Cuvier,
  the intestines of the domesticated pig exceed greatly in proportionate
  length those of the wild boar. In the tame and wild rabbit the change is
  of an opposite nature, and probably results from the nutritious food
  given to the tame rabbit.<a name="NtA_749"

  <p><i>Changed Habits of Life, independently of the Use or Disuse of
  particular Organs.</i>&mdash;This subject, as far as the mental powers of
  animals are concerned, so blends into instinct, on which I shall treat in
  a future work, that I will here only remind the reader of the many cases
  which occur under domestication, and which are familiar to every
  one&mdash;for instance the tameness of our animals&mdash;the pointing or
  retrieving of dogs&mdash;their not attacking the smaller animals kept by
  man&mdash;and so forth. How much of these changes ought to be attributed
  to inherited habit, and how much to the selection of individuals which
  have varied in the desired manner, irrespectively of the special
  circumstances under which they have been kept, can seldom be told. We
  have already seen that animals may be habituated to a changed diet; but a
  few additional instances may here be given.</p>

  <p>In the Polynesian Islands and in China the dog is fed exclusively on
  vegetable matter, and the taste for this kind of food is to a certain
  extent inherited.<a name="NtA_750" href="#Nt_750"><sup>[750]</sup></a>
  Our sporting dogs will not touch the bones of game birds, whilst other
  dogs devour them with greediness. In some parts of the world sheep have
  been largely fed on fish. The domestic hog is fond of barley, the wild
  boar is said to disdain it; and the disdain is partially inherited, for
  some young wild pigs bred in captivity showed an aversion for this grain,
  whilst others of the same brood relished it.<a name="NtA_751"
  href="#Nt_751"><sup>[751]</sup></a> One of my relations bred some young
  pigs from <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page304"></a>{304}</span>a Chinese sow by a wild Alpine boar; they
  lived free in the park, and were so tame that they came to the house to
  be fed; but they would not touch swill, which was devoured by the other
  pigs. An animal when once accustomed to an unnatural diet, which can
  generally be effected only during youth, dislikes its proper food, as
  Spallanzani found to be the case with a pigeon which had been long fed on
  meat. Individuals of the same species take to new food with different
  degrees of readiness; one horse, it is stated, soon learned to eat meat,
  whilst another would have perished from hunger rather than have partaken
  of it.<a name="NtA_752" href="#Nt_752"><sup>[752]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The caterpillars of the <i>Bombyx hesperus</i> feed in a state of
  nature on the leaves of the <i>Café diable</i>, but, after having been
  reared on the Ailanthus, they would not touch the <i>Café diable</i>, and
  actually died of hunger.<a name="NtA_753"
  href="#Nt_753"><sup>[753]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It has been found possible to accustom marine fish to live in fresh
  water; but as such changes in fish, and other marine animals, have been
  chiefly observed in a state of nature, they do not properly belong to our
  present subject. The period of gestation and of maturity, as shown in the
  earlier chapters,&mdash;the season and the frequency of the act of
  breeding,&mdash;have all been greatly modified under domestication. With
  the Egyptian goose the rate of change in the season has been recorded.<a
  name="NtA_754" href="#Nt_754"><sup>[754]</sup></a> The wild drake pairs
  with one female, the domestic drake is polygamous. Certain breeds of
  fowls have lost the habit of incubation. The paces of the horse, and the
  manner of flight in certain breeds of the pigeon, have been modified, and
  are inherited. The voice differs much in certain fowls and pigeons. Some
  breeds are clamorous and others silent, as in the Call and common duck,
  or in the Spitz and pointer dog. Every one knows how dogs differ from
  each other in their manner of hunting, and in their ardour after
  different kinds of game or vermin.</p>

  <p>With plants the period of vegetation is easily changed and is
  inherited, as in the case of summer and winter wheat, barley, <!-- Page
  305 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305"></a>{305}</span>and
  vetches; but to this subject we shall immediately return under
  acclimatisation. Annual plants sometimes become perennial under a new
  climate, as I hear from Dr. Hooker is the case with the stock and
  mignonette in Tasmania. On the other hand, perennials sometimes become
  annuals, as with the Ricinus in England, and as, according to Captain
  Mangles, with many varieties of the heartsease. Von Berg<a name="NtA_755"
  href="#Nt_755"><sup>[755]</sup></a> raised from seed of <i>Verbascum
  ph&oelig;nicium</i>, which is usually a biennial, both annual and
  perennial varieties. Some deciduous bushes become evergreen in hot
  countries.<a name="NtA_756" href="#Nt_756"><sup>[756]</sup></a> Rice
  requires much water, but there is one variety in India which can be grown
  without irrigation.<a name="NtA_757" href="#Nt_757"><sup>[757]</sup></a>
  Certain varieties of the oat and of our other cereals are best fitted for
  certain soils.<a name="NtA_758" href="#Nt_758"><sup>[758]</sup></a>
  Endless similar facts could be given in the animal and vegetable
  kingdoms. They are noticed here because they illustrate analogous
  differences in closely allied natural species, and because such changed
  habits of life, whether due to use and disuse, or to the direct action of
  external conditions, or to so-called spontaneous variation, would be apt
  to lead to modifications of structure.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Acclimatisation.</i>&mdash;From the previous remarks we are
  naturally led to the much disputed subject of acclimatisation. There are
  two distinct questions: Do varieties descended from the same species
  differ in their power of living under different climates? And secondly,
  if they so differ, how have they become thus adapted? We have seen that
  European dogs do not succeed well in India, and it is asserted,<a
  name="NtA_759" href="#Nt_759"><sup>[759]</sup></a> that no one has
  succeeded in there keeping the Newfoundland long alive; but then it may
  be argued, probably with truth, that these northern breeds are
  specifically distinct from the native dogs which flourish in India. The
  same remark may be made with respect to different breeds of sheep, of
  which, according to Youatt,<a name="NtA_760"
  href="#Nt_760"><sup>[760]</sup></a> not one brought "from a torrid
  climate lasts out the second year," in the Zoological Gardens. But sheep
  are capable of some degree of acclimatisation, for Merino sheep bred at
  the Cape of Good Hope have been found <!-- Page 306 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>{306}</span>far better adapted for
  India than those imported from England.<a name="NtA_761"
  href="#Nt_761"><sup>[761]</sup></a> It is almost certain that the breeds
  of the fowl are descended from the same species; but the Spanish breed,
  which there is good reason to believe originated near the
  Mediterranean,<a name="NtA_762" href="#Nt_762"><sup>[762]</sup></a>
  though so fine and vigorous in England, suffers more from frost than any
  other breed. The Arrindy silk-moth introduced from Bengal, and the
  Ailanthus moth from the temperate province of Shan Tung, in China, belong
  to the same species, as we may infer from their identity in the
  caterpillar, cocoon, and mature states;<a name="NtA_763"
  href="#Nt_763"><sup>[763]</sup></a> yet they differ much in constitution:
  the Indian form "will flourish only in warm latitudes," the other is
  quite hardy and withstands cold and rain.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Plants are more strictly adapted to climate than are animals. The
  latter when domesticated withstand such great diversities of climate,
  that we find nearly the same species in tropical and temperate countries;
  whilst the cultivated plants are widely dissimilar. Hence a larger field
  is open for inquiry in regard to the acclimatisation of plants than of
  animals. It is no exaggeration to say that with almost every plant which
  has long been cultivated varieties exist, which are endowed with
  constitutions fitted for very different climates; I will select only a
  few of the more striking cases, as it would be tedious to give all. In
  North America numerous fruit-trees have been raised, and in horticultural
  publications,&mdash;for instance, in Downing,&mdash;lists are given of
  the varieties which are best able to withstand the severe climate of the
  northern States and Canada. Many American varieties of the pear, plum,
  and peach are excellent in their own country, but until recently hardly
  one was known that succeeded in England; and with apples,<a
  name="NtA_764" href="#Nt_764"><sup>[764]</sup></a> not one succeeds.
  Though the American varieties can withstand a severer winter than ours,
  the summer here is not hot enough. Fruit-trees have originated in Europe
  as in America with different constitutions, but they are not here much
  noticed, as the same nurserymen do not supply a wide area. The Forelle
  pear flowers early, and when the flowers have just set, and this is the
  critical period, they have been observed, both in France and England, to
  withstand with complete impunity a frost of 18° and even 14° Fahr., which
  killed the flowers, whether fully expanded or in bud, of all other kinds
  of pears.<a name="NtA_765" href="#Nt_765"><sup>[765]</sup></a> This power
  in the flower of resisting cold and afterwards producing fruit does not
  invariably depend, as we know on good authority,<a name="NtA_766"
  href="#Nt_766"><sup>[766]</sup></a> on general constitutional vigour.</p>

<p><!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page307"></a>{307}</span></p>

  <p>In proceeding northward, the number of varieties which are enabled to
  resist the climate rapidly decreases, as may be seen in the list of the
  varieties of the cherry, apple, and pear, which can be cultivated in the
  neighbourhood of Stockholm.<a name="NtA_767"
  href="#Nt_767"><sup>[767]</sup></a> Near Moscow, Prince Troubetzkoy
  planted for experiment in the open ground several varieties of the pear,
  but one alone, the <i>Poire sans Pepins</i>, withstood the cold of
  winter.<a name="NtA_768" href="#Nt_768"><sup>[768]</sup></a> We thus see
  that our fruit-trees, like distinct species of the same genus, certainly
  differ from each other in their constitutional adaptation to different
  climates.</p>

  <p>With the varieties of many plants, the adaptation to climate is often
  very close. Thus it has been proved by repeated trials "that few if any
  of the English varieties of wheat are adapted for cultivation in
  Scotland;"<a name="NtA_769" href="#Nt_769"><sup>[769]</sup></a> but the
  failure in this case is at first only in the quantity, though ultimately
  in the quality, of the grain produced. The Rev. J.&nbsp;M. Berkeley sowed
  wheat-seed from India, and got "the most meagre ears," on land which
  would certainly have yielded a good crop from English wheat.<a
  name="NtA_770" href="#Nt_770"><sup>[770]</sup></a> In these cases
  varieties have been carried from a warmer to a cooler climate; in the
  reverse case, as "when wheat was imported directly from France into the
  West Indian Islands, it produced either wholly barren spikes or furnished
  with only two or three miserable seeds, while West Indian seed by its
  side yielded an enormous harvest."<a name="NtA_771"
  href="#Nt_771"><sup>[771]</sup></a> Here is another case of close
  adaptation to a slightly cooler climate; a kind of wheat which in England
  may be used indifferently either as a winter or summer variety, when sown
  under the warmer climate of Grignan, in France, behaved exactly as if it
  had been a true winter wheat.<a name="NtA_772"
  href="#Nt_772"><sup>[772]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Botanists believe that all the varieties of maize belong to the same
  species; and we have seen that in North America, in proceeding northward,
  the varieties cultivated in each zone produce their flowers and ripen
  their seed within shorter and shorter periods. So that the tall, slowly
  maturing southern varieties do not succeed in New England, and the New
  English varieties do not succeed in Canada. I have not met with any
  statement that the southern varieties are actually injured or killed by a
  degree of cold which the northern varieties withstand with impunity,
  though this is probable; but the production of early flowering and early
  seeding varieties deserves to be considered as one form of
  acclimatisation. Hence it has been found possible, according to Kalm, to
  cultivate maize further and further northwards in America. In Europe,
  also, as we learn from the evidence given by Alph. De Candolle, the
  culture of maize has extended since the end of the last century thirty
  leagues north of its former boundary.<a name="NtA_773"
  href="#Nt_773"><sup>[773]</sup></a> On the authority of the great
  Linnæus,<a name="NtA_774" href="#Nt_774"><sup>[774]</sup></a> I may quote
  an <!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page308"></a>{308}</span>analogous case, namely, that in Sweden
  tobacco raised from home-grown seed ripens its seed a month sooner and is
  less liable to miscarry than plants raised from foreign seed.</p>

  <p>With the Vine, differently from the maize, the line of practical
  culture has retreated a little southward since the middle ages;<a
  name="NtA_775" href="#Nt_775"><sup>[775]</sup></a> but this seems due to
  commerce, including that of wine, being now freer or more easy.
  Nevertheless the fact of the vine not having spread northward shows that
  acclimatisation has made no progress during several centuries. There is,
  however, a marked difference in the constitution of the several
  varieties,&mdash;some being hardy, whilst others, like the muscat of
  Alexandria, require a very high temperature to come to perfection.
  According to Labat,<a name="NtA_776" href="#Nt_776"><sup>[776]</sup></a>
  vines taken from France to the West Indies succeed with extreme
  difficulty, whilst those imported from Madeira, or the Canary Islands,
  thrive admirably.</p>

  <p>Gallesio gives a curious account of the naturalisation of the Orange
  in Italy. Daring many centuries the sweet orange was propagated
  exclusively by grafts, and so often suffered from frosts that it required
  protection. After the severe frost of 1709, and more especially after
  that of 1763, so many trees were destroyed that seedlings from the sweet
  orange were raised, and, to the surprise of the inhabitants, their fruit
  was found to be sweet. The trees thus raised were larger, more
  productive, and hardier than the former kinds; and seedlings are now
  continually raised. Hence Gallesio concludes that much more was effected
  for the naturalisation of the orange in Italy by the accidental
  production of new kinds during a period of about sixty years, than had
  been effected by grafting old varieties during many ages.<a
  name="NtA_777" href="#Nt_777"><sup>[777]</sup></a> I may add that Risso<a
  name="NtA_778" href="#Nt_778"><sup>[778]</sup></a> describes some
  Portuguese varieties of the orange as extremely sensitive to cold, and as
  much tenderer than certain other varieties.</p>

  <p>The peach was known to Theophrastus, 322 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span><a name="NtA_779"
  href="#Nt_779"><sup>[779]</sup></a> According to the authorities quoted
  by Dr. F. Rolle,<a name="NtA_780" href="#Nt_780"><sup>[780]</sup></a> it
  was tender when first introduced into Greece, and even in the island of
  Rhodes only occasionally bore fruit. If this be correct, the peach, in
  spreading during the last two thousand years over the middle parts of
  Europe, must have become much hardier. At the present day different
  varieties differ much in hardiness: some French varieties will not
  succeed in England; and near Paris, the <i>Pavie de Bonneuil</i> does not
  ripen its fruit till very late, even when grown on a wall; "it is,
  therefore, only fit for a very hot southern climate."<a name="NtA_781"
  href="#Nt_781"><sup>[781]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I will briefly give a few other cases. A variety of <i>Magnolia
  grandiflora</i>, raised by M. Roy, withstands cold several degrees lower
  than that which any other variety can resist. With camellias there is
  much difference in hardiness. One particular variety of Noisette rose
  withstood the severe frost of 1860 "untouched and hale amidst a universal
  destruction of other <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page309"></a>{309}</span>Noisettes." In New York the "Irish yew is
  quite hardy, but the common yew is liable to be cut down." I may add that
  there are varieties of the sweet potato (<i>Convolvulus batatas</i>)
  which are suited for warmer, as well as for colder, climates.<a
  name="NtA_782" href="#Nt_782"><sup>[782]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The plants as yet mentioned have been found capable of resisting an
  unusual degree of cold or heat, when fully grown. The following cases
  refer to plants whilst young. In a large bed of young Araucarias of the
  same age, growing close together and equally exposed, it was observed,<a
  name="NtA_783" href="#Nt_783"><sup>[783]</sup></a> after the unusually
  severe winter of 1860-61, that, "in the midst of the dying, numerous
  individuals remained on which the frost had absolutely made no kind of
  impression." Dr. Lindley, after alluding to this and other similar cases,
  remarks, "Among the lessons which the late formidable winter has taught
  us, is that, even in their power of resisting cold, individuals of the
  same species of plants are remarkably different." Near Salisbury, there
  was a sharp frost on the night of May 24th, 1836, and all the French
  beans (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) in a bed were killed except about one
  in thirty, which completely escaped.<a name="NtA_784"
  href="#Nt_784"><sup>[784]</sup></a> On the same day of the month, but in
  the year 1864, there was a severe frost in Kent, and two rows of
  scarlet-runners (<i>P. multiflorus</i>) in my garden, containing 390
  plants of the same age and equally exposed, were all blackened and killed
  except about a dozen plants. In an adjoining row of "Fulmer's dwarf bean"
  (<i>P. vulgaris</i>), one single plant escaped. A still more severe frost
  occurred four days afterwards, and of the dozen plants which had
  previously escaped only three survived; these were not taller or more
  vigorous than the other young plants, but they escaped completely, with
  not even the tips of their leaves browned. It was impossible to behold
  these three plants, with their blackened, withered, and dead brethren all
  round them, and not see at a glance that they differed widely in
  constitutional power of resisting frost.</p>

  <p>This work is not the proper place to show that wild plants <!-- Page
  310 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>{310}</span>of the
  same species, naturally growing at different altitudes or under different
  latitudes, become to a certain extent acclimatised, as is proved by the
  different behaviour of their seedlings when raised in England. In my
  'Origin of Species' I have alluded to some cases, and I could add others.
  One instance must suffice: Mr. Grigor, of Forres,<a name="NtA_785"
  href="#Nt_785"><sup>[785]</sup></a> states that seedlings of the Scotch
  fir (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>), raised from seed from the Continent and
  from the forests of Scotland, differ much. "The difference is perceptible
  in one-year-old, and more so in two-year-old seedlings; but the effects
  of the winter on the second year's growth almost uniformly makes those
  from the Continent quite brown, and so damaged, that by the month of
  March they are quite unsaleable, while the plants from the native Scotch
  pine, under the same treatment, and standing alongside, although
  considerably shorter, are rather stouter and quite green, so that the
  beds of the one can be known from the other when seen from the distance
  of a mile." Closely similar facts have been observed with seedling
  larches.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Hardy varieties would alone be valued or noticed in Europe; whilst
  tender varieties, requiring more warmth, would generally be neglected;
  but such occasionally arise. Thus Loudon<a name="NtA_786"
  href="#Nt_786"><sup>[786]</sup></a> describes a Cornish variety of the
  elm which is almost an evergreen, and of which the shoots are often
  killed by the autumnal frosts, so that its timber is of little value.
  Horticulturists know that some varieties are much more tender than
  others: thus all the varieties of the broccoli are more tender than
  cabbages; but there is much difference in this respect in the
  sub-varieties of the broccoli; the pink and purple kinds are a little
  hardier than the white Cape broccoli, "but they are not to be depended on
  after the thermometer falls below 24° Fahr.:" the Walcheren broccoli is
  less tender than the Cape, and there are several varieties which will
  stand much severer cold than the Walcheren.<a name="NtA_787"
  href="#Nt_787"><sup>[787]</sup></a> Cauliflowers seed more freely in
  India than cabbages.<a name="NtA_788" href="#Nt_788"><sup>[788]</sup></a>
  To give one instance with flowers: eleven plants raised from a hollyhock,
  called the <i>Queen of the Whites</i>,<a name="NtA_789"
  href="#Nt_789"><sup>[789]</sup></a> were found to be much more tender
  than various other seedlings. It may be presumed that all tender
  varieties would succeed better under a climate warmer than ours. With
  fruit-trees, it is well known that certain varieties, for instance of the
  peach, stand forcing in a hot-house better than others; and this shows
  <!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page311"></a>{311}</span>either pliability of organisation or some
  constitutional difference. The same individual cherry-tree, when forced,
  has been observed during successive years gradually to change its period
  of vegetation.<a name="NtA_790" href="#Nt_790"><sup>[790]</sup></a> Few
  pelargoniums can resist the heat of a stove, but <i>Alba multiflora</i>
  will, as a most skilful gardener asserts, "stand pine-apple top and
  bottom heat the whole winter, without looking any more drawn than if it
  had stood in a common greenhouse; and <i>Blanche Fleur</i> seems as if it
  had been made on purpose for growing in winter, like many bulbs, and to
  rest all summer."<a name="NtA_791" href="#Nt_791"><sup>[791]</sup></a>
  There can hardly be a doubt that the <i>Alba multiflora</i> pelargonium
  must have a widely different constitution from that of most other
  varieties of this plant; it would probably withstand even an equatorial
  climate.</p>

  <p>We have seen that according to Labat the vine and wheat require
  acclimatisation in order to succeed in the West Indies. Similar facts
  have been observed at Madras: "two parcels of mignonette-seed, one direct
  from Europe, the other saved at Bangalore (of which the mean temperature
  is much below that of Madras) were sown at the same time: they both
  vegetated equally favourably, but the former all died off a few days
  after they appeared above ground; the latter still survive, and are
  vigorous healthy plants." So again, "turnip and carrot seed saved at
  Hyderabad are found to answer better at Madras than seed from Europe or
  from the Cape of Good Hope."<a name="NtA_792"
  href="#Nt_792"><sup>[792]</sup></a> Mr. J. Scott, of the Calcutta Botanic
  Gardens, informs me that seeds of the sweet-pea (<i>Lathyrus
  odoratus</i>) imported from England produce plants, with thick, rigid
  stems and small leaves, which rarely blossom and never yield seed; plants
  raised from French seed blossom sparingly, but all the flowers are
  sterile; on the other hand, plants raised from sweet-peas grown near
  Darjeeling in Upper India, but originally derived from England, can be
  successfully cultivated on the plains of India; for they flower and seed
  profusely, and their stems are lax and scandent. In some of the foregoing
  cases, as Dr. Hooker has remarked to me, the greater success may perhaps
  be attributed to the seeds having been more fully ripened under a more
  favourable climate; but this view can hardly be extended to so many
  cases, including plants, which, from being cultivated under a climate
  hotter than their native one, become fitted for a still hotter climate.
  We may therefore safely conclude that plants can to a certain extent
  become accustomed to a climate either hotter or colder than their own;
  although these latter cases have been more frequently observed.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We will now consider the means by which acclimatisation may be
  effected, namely, through the spontaneous appearance of varieties having
  a different constitution, and through the effects of use or habit. In
  regard to the first process, there is no evidence that a change in the
  constitution of the <!-- Page 312 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page312"></a>{312}</span>offspring necessarily stands in any direct
  relation with the nature of the climate inhabited by the parents. On the
  contrary, it is certain that hardy and tender varieties of the same
  species appear in the same country. New varieties thus spontaneously
  arising become fitted to slightly different climates in two different
  ways; firstly, they may have the power, either as seedlings or when
  full-grown, of resisting intense cold, as with the Moscow pear, or of
  resisting intense heat, as with some kinds of Pelargonium, or the flowers
  may withstand severe frost, as with the Forelle pear. Secondly, plants
  may become adapted to climates widely different from their own, from
  flowering and fruiting either earlier or later in the season. In both
  these cases the power of acclimatisation by man consists simply in the
  selection and preservation of new varieties. But without any direct
  intention on his part of securing a hardier variety, acclimatisation may
  be unconsciously effected by merely raising tender plants from seed, and
  by occasionally attempting their cultivation further and further
  northwards, as in the case of maize, the orange, and the peach.</p>

  <p>How much influence ought to be attributed to inherited habit or custom
  in the acclimatisation of animals and plants is a much more difficult
  question. In many cases natural selection can hardly have failed to have
  come into play and complicated the result. It is notorious that mountain
  sheep resist severe weather and storms of snow which would destroy
  lowland breeds; but then mountain sheep have been thus exposed from time
  immemorial, and all delicate individuals will have been destroyed, and
  the hardiest preserved. So with the Arrindy silk-moths of China and
  India; who can tell how far natural selection may have taken a share in
  the formation of the two races, which are now fitted for such widely
  different climates? It seems at first probable that the many fruit-trees,
  which are so well fitted for the hot summers and cold winters of North
  America, in contrast with their poor success under our climate, have
  become adapted through habit; but when we reflect on the multitude of
  seedlings annually raised in that country, and that none would succeed
  unless born with a fitting constitution, it is possible that mere habit
  may have done nothing towards their acclimatisation. On the other hand,
  when we <!-- Page 313 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page313"></a>{313}</span>hear that Merino sheep, bred during no
  great number of generations at the Cape of Good Hope&mdash;that some
  European plants raised during only a few generations in the cooler parts
  of India, withstand the hotter parts of that country much better than the
  sheep or seeds imported directly from England, we must attribute some
  influence to habit. We are led to the same conclusion when we hear from
  Naudin<a name="NtA_793" href="#Nt_793"><sup>[793]</sup></a> that the
  races of melons, squashes, and gourds, which have long been cultivated in
  Northern Europe, are comparatively more precocious, and need much less
  heat for maturing their fruit, than the varieties of the same species
  recently brought from tropical regions. In the reciprocal conversion of
  summer and winter wheat, barley, and vetches into each other, habit
  produces a marked effect in the course of a very few generations. The
  same thing apparently occurs with the varieties of maize, which, when
  carried from the Southern to the Northern States of America, or into
  Germany, soon become accustomed to their new homes. With vine-plants
  taken to the West Indies from Madeira, which are said to succeed better
  than plants brought directly from France, we have some degree of
  acclimatisation in the individual, independently of the production of new
  varieties by seed.</p>

  <p>The common experience of agriculturists is of some value, and they
  often advise persons to be cautious in trying in one country the
  productions of another. The ancient agricultural writers of China
  recommend the preservation and cultivation of the varieties peculiar to
  each country. During the classical period, Columella wrote, "Vernaculum
  pecus peregrino longe præstantius est."<a name="NtA_794"
  href="#Nt_794"><sup>[794]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I am aware that the attempt to acclimatise either animals or plants
  has been called a vain chimæra. No doubt the attempt in most cases
  deserves to be thus called, if made independently of the production of
  new varieties endowed with a different constitution. Habit, however much
  prolonged, rarely produces any effect on a plant propagated by buds; it
  apparently acts only through successive seminal generations. <!-- Page
  314 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>{314}</span>The
  laurel, bay, laurestinus, &amp;c., and the Jerusalem artichoke, which are
  propagated by cuttings or tubers, are probably now as tender in England
  as when first introduced; and this appears to be the case with the
  potato, which until recently was seldom multiplied by seed. With plants
  propagated by seed, and with animals, there will be little or no
  acclimatisation unless the hardier individuals are either intentionally
  or unconsciously preserved. The kidney-bean has often been advanced as an
  instance of a plant which has not become hardier since its first
  introduction into Britain. We hear, however, on excellent authority,<a
  name="NtA_795" href="#Nt_795"><sup>[795]</sup></a> that some very fine
  seed, imported from abroad, produced plants "which blossomed most
  profusely, but were nearly all but abortive, whilst plants grown
  alongside from English seed podded abundantly;" and this apparently shows
  some degree of acclimatisation in our English plants. We have also seen
  that seedlings of the kidney-bean occasionally appear with a marked power
  of resisting frost; but no one, as far as I can hear, has ever separated
  such hardy seedlings, so as to prevent accidental crossing, and then
  gathered their seed, and repeated the process year after year. It may,
  however, be objected with truth that natural selection ought to have had
  a decided effect on the hardiness of our kidney-beans; for the tenderest
  individuals must have been killed during every severe spring, and the
  hardier preserved. But it should be borne in mind that the result of
  increased hardiness would simply be that gardeners, who are always
  anxious for as early a crop as possible, would sow their seed a few days
  earlier than formerly. Now, as the period of sowing depends much on the
  soil and elevation of each district, and varies with the season; and as
  new varieties have often been imported from abroad, can we feel sure that
  our kidney-beans are not somewhat hardier? I have not been able, by
  searching old horticultural works, to answer this question
  satisfactorily.</p>

  <p>On the whole the facts now given show that, though habit does
  something towards acclimatisation, yet that the spontaneous appearance of
  constitutionally different individuals is a far more effective agent. As
  no single instance has been recorded, either with animals or plants, of
  hardier individuals <!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page315"></a>{315}</span>having been long and steadily selected,
  though such selection is admitted to be indispensable for the improvement
  of any other character, it is not surprising that man has done little in
  the acclimatisation of domesticated animals and cultivated plants. We
  need not, however, doubt that under nature new races and new species
  would become adapted to widely different climates, by spontaneous
  variation, aided by habit, and regulated by natural selection.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Arrests of Development: Rudimentary and Aborted Organs.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>These subjects are here introduced because there is reason to believe
  that rudimentary organs are in many cases the result of disuse.
  Modifications of structure from arrested development, so great or so
  serious as to deserve to be called monstrosities, are of common
  occurrence, but, as they differ much from any normal structure, they
  require here only a passing notice. When a part or organ is arrested
  during its embryonic growth, a rudiment is generally left. Thus the whole
  head may be represented by a soft nipple-like projection, and the limbs
  by mere papillæ. These rudiments of limbs are sometimes inherited, as has
  been observed in a dog.<a name="NtA_796"
  href="#Nt_796"><sup>[796]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Many lesser anomalies in our domesticated animals appear to be due to
  arrested development. What the cause of the arrest may be, we seldom
  know, except in the case of direct injury to the embryo within the egg or
  womb. That the cause does not generally act at a very early embryonic
  period we may infer from the affected organ seldom being wholly
  aborted,&mdash;a rudiment being generally preserved. The external ears
  are represented by mere vestiges in a Chinese breed of sheep; and in
  another breed, the tail is reduced "to a little button, suffocated, in a
  manner, by fat."<a name="NtA_797" href="#Nt_797"><sup>[797]</sup></a> In
  tailless dogs and cats a stump is left; but I do not know whether it
  includes at an early embryonic age rudiments of all the caudal vertebræ.
  In certain breeds of fowls the comb and wattles are reduced to rudiments;
  in the Cochin-China breed scarcely more than rudiments of spurs exist.
  With polled Suffolk cattle, "rudiments of horns can often be felt at an
  early age;"<a name="NtA_798" href="#Nt_798"><sup>[798]</sup></a> and with
  species in a state of nature, the relatively greater development of
  rudimentary organs at an early period of life is highly characteristic of
  such organs. With hornless breeds of cattle and sheep; another and
  singular kind of rudiment has been observed, namely, minute dangling
  horns attached to the skin alone, and which are often shed and grow
  again. With hornless goats, according to Desmarest,<a name="NtA_799"
  href="#Nt_799"><sup>[799]</sup></a> <!-- Page 316 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>{316}</span>the bony protuberances
  which properly support the horns exist as mere rudiments.</p>

  <p>With cultivated plants it is far from rare to find the petals,
  stamens, and pistils represented by rudiments, like those observed in
  natural species. So it is with the whole seed in many fruits; thus near
  Astrakhan there is a grape with mere traces of seeds, "so small and lying
  so near the stalk that they are not perceived in eating the grape."<a
  name="NtA_800" href="#Nt_800"><sup>[800]</sup></a> In certain varieties
  of the gourd, the tendrils, according to Naudin, are represented by
  rudiments or by various monstrous growths. In the broccoli and
  cauliflower the greater number of the flowers are incapable of expansion,
  and include rudimentary organs. In the Feather hyacinth (<i>Muscari
  comosum</i>) the upper and central flowers are brightly coloured but
  rudimentary; under cultivation the tendency to abortion travels downwards
  and outwards, and all the flowers become rudimentary; but the abortive
  stamens and pistils are not so small in the lower as in the upper
  flowers. In the <i>Viburnum opulus</i>, on the other hand, the outer
  flowers naturally have their organs of fructification in a rudimentary
  state, and the corolla is of large size; under cultivation, the change
  spreads to the centre, and all the flowers become affected; thus the
  well-known Snow-ball bush is produced. In the Compositæ, the so-called
  doubling of the flowers consists in the greater development of the
  corolla of the central florets, generally accompanied with some degree of
  sterility; and it has been observed<a name="NtA_801"
  href="#Nt_801"><sup>[801]</sup></a> that the progressive doubling
  invariably spreads from the circumference to the centre,&mdash;that is,
  from the ray florets, which so often include rudimentary organs, to those
  of the disc. I may add, as bearing on this subject, that, with Asters,
  seeds taken from the florets of the circumference have been found to
  yield the greatest number of double flowers.<a name="NtA_802"
  href="#Nt_802"><sup>[802]</sup></a> In these several cases we have a
  natural tendency in certain parts to become rudimentary, and this under
  culture spreads either to, or from, the axis of the plant. It deserves
  notice, as showing how the same laws govern the changes which natural
  species and artificial varieties undergo, that in a series of species in
  the genus Carthamus, one of the Compositæ, a tendency in the seeds to the
  abortion of the pappus may be traced extending from the circumference to
  the centre of the disc: thus, according to A. de Jussieu,<a
  name="NtA_803" href="#Nt_803"><sup>[803]</sup></a> the abortion is only
  partial in <i>Carthamus creticus</i>, but more extended in <i>C.
  lanatus</i>; for in this species two or three alone of the central seeds
  are furnished with a pappus, the surrounding seeds being either quite
  naked or furnished with a few hairs; and lastly, in <i>C. tinctorius</i>,
  even the central seeds are destitute of pappus, and the abortion is
  complete.</p>

  <p>With animals and plants under domestication, when an organ disappears,
  leaving only a rudiment, the loss has generally been sudden, as with
  hornless and tailless breeds; and such cases may be ranked as inherited
  monstrosities. But in some few cases the loss has been gradual, and <!--
  Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page317"></a>{317}</span>has
  been partly effected by selection, as with the rudimentary combs and
  wattles of certain fowls. We have also seen that the wings of some
  domesticated birds have been slightly reduced by disuse, and the great
  reduction of the wings in certain silk-moths, with mere rudiments left,
  has probably been aided by disuse.</p>

  <p>With species in a state of nature, rudimentary organs are so extremely
  common that scarcely one can be named which is wholly free from a blemish
  of this nature. Such organs are generally variable, as several
  naturalists have observed; for, being useless, they are not regulated by
  natural selection, and they are more or less liable to reversion. The
  same rule certainly holds good with parts which have become rudimentary
  under domestication. We do not know through what steps under nature
  rudimentary organs have passed in being reduced to their present
  condition; but we so incessantly see in species of the same group the
  finest gradations between an organ in a rudimentary and perfect state,
  that we are led to believe that the passage must have been extremely
  gradual. It may be doubted whether a change of structure so abrupt as the
  sudden loss of an organ would ever be of service to a species in a state
  of nature; for the conditions to which all organisms are closely adapted
  usually change very slowly. Even if an organ did suddenly disappear in
  some one individual by an arrest of development, intercrossing with the
  other individuals of the same species would cause it to reappear in a
  more or less perfect manner, so that its final reduction could only be
  effected by the slow process of continued disuse or natural selection. It
  is much more probable that, from changed habits of life, organs first
  become of less and less use, and ultimately superfluous; or their place
  may be supplied by some other organ; and then disuse, acting on the
  offspring through inheritance at corresponding periods of life, would go
  on reducing the organ; but as most organs could be of no use at an early
  embryonic period, they would not be affected by disuse; consequently they
  would be preserved at this stage of growth, and would remain as
  rudiments. In addition to the effects of disuse, the principle of economy
  of growth, already alluded to in this chapter, would lead to the still
  further reduction of all superfluous parts. With respect to the final and
  total suppression or abortion of any organ, another and distinct
  principle, which will be discussed in the chapter on pangenesis, probably
  takes a share in the work.</p>

  <p>With animals and plants reared by man there is no severe or recurrent
  struggle for existence, and the principle of economy will not come into
  action. So far, indeed, is this from being the case, that in some
  instances organs, which are naturally rudimentary in the parent-species,
  become partially redeveloped in the domesticated descendants. Thus cows,
  like most other ruminants, properly have four active and two rudimentary
  mammæ; but in our domesticated animals, the latter occasionally become
  considerably developed and yield milk. The atrophied mammæ, which, in
  male domesticated animals, including man, have in some rare cases grown
  to full size and secreted milk, perhaps offer an analogous case. The hind
  feet of dogs include rudiments of a fifth toe, and in certain large
  breeds these toes, though still rudimentary, become considerably
  developed <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>{318}</span>and are furnished with claws. In the
  common Hen, the spurs and comb are rudimentary, but in certain breeds
  these become, independently of age or disease of the ovaria, well
  developed. The stallion has canine teeth, but the mare has only traces of
  the alveoli, which, as I am informed by the eminent veterinary Mr. G.&nbsp;T.
  Brown, frequently contain minute irregular nodules of bone. These
  nodules, however, sometimes become developed into imperfect teeth,
  protruding through the gums and coated with enamel; and occasionally they
  grow to a third or even a fourth of the length of the canines in the
  stallion. With plants I do not know whether the redevelopment of
  rudimentary organs occurs more frequently under culture than under
  nature. Perhaps the pear-tree may be a case in point, for when wild it
  bears thorns, which though useful as a protection are formed of branches
  in a <span class="correction" title="Original reads `rudimentry'."
  >rudimentary</span> condition, but, when the tree is cultivated, the
  thorns are reconverted into branches.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Finally, though organs which must be classed as rudimentary frequently
  occur in our domesticated animals and cultivated plants, these have
  generally been formed suddenly, through an arrest of development. They
  usually differ in appearance from the rudiments which so frequently
  characterise natural species. In the latter, rudimentary organs have been
  slowly formed through continued disuse, acting by inheritance at a
  corresponding age, aided by the principle of the economy of growth, all
  under the control of natural selection. With domesticated animals, on the
  other hand, the principle of economy is far from coming into action, and
  their organs, although often slightly reduced by disuse, are not thus
  almost obliterated with mere rudiments left.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>All the parts of the organisation are to a certain extent connected or
  correlated together; but the connexion may be so slight that it hardly
  exists, as with compound animals or the buds on the same tree. Even in
  the higher animals various parts are not at all closely related; for one
  part may be wholly suppressed or rendered monstrous without any other
  part of the body being affected. But in some cases, when one part varies,
  certain other parts always, or nearly always, simultaneously vary; they
  are then subject to the law of correlated variation. Formerly I used the
  somewhat vague expression of correlation of growth, which may be applied
  to many large classes of facts. Thus, all the parts of the body are
  admirably coordinated for the peculiar habits of life of each organic
  being, and they may be said, as the Duke of Argyll insists in his 'Reign
  of Law,' to be correlated for this purpose. Again, in large groups of
  animals certain structures always co-exist; for instance, a peculiar form
  of stomach with teeth of peculiar form, and such structures may in one
  sense be said to be correlated. But these cases have no necessary
  connexion with the law to be discussed in the present chapter; for we do
  not know that <!-- Page 320 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page320"></a>{320}</span>the initial or primary variations of the
  several parts were in any way related; slight modifications or individual
  differences may have been preserved, first in one and then in another
  part, until the final and perfectly co-adapted structure was acquired;
  but to this subject I shall presently recur. Again, in many groups of
  animals the males alone are furnished with weapons, or are ornamented
  with gay colours; and these characters manifestly stand in some sort of
  correlation with the male reproductive organs, for when the latter are
  destroyed these characters disappear. But it was shown in the twelfth
  chapter that the very same peculiarity may become attached at any age to
  either sex, and afterwards be exclusively transmitted by the same sex at
  a corresponding age. In these cases we have inheritance limited by, or
  correlated with, both sex and age; but we have no reason for supposing
  that the original cause of the variation was necessarily connected with
  the reproductive organs, or with the age of the affected being.</p>

  <p>In cases of true correlated variation, we are sometimes able to see
  the nature of the connexion; but in most cases the bond is hidden from
  us, and certainly differs in different cases. We can seldom say which of
  two correlated parts first varies, and induces a change in the other; or
  whether the two are simultaneously produced by some distinct cause.
  Correlated variation is an important subject for us; for when one part is
  modified through continued selection, either by man or under nature,
  other parts of the organisation will be unavoidably modified. From this
  correlation it apparently follows that, with our domesticated animals and
  plants, varieties rarely or never differ from each other by some single
  character alone.</p>

  <p>One of the simplest cases of correlation is that a modification which
  arises during an early stage of growth tends to influence the subsequent
  development of the same part, as well as of other and intimately
  connected parts. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire states<a name="NtA_804"
  href="#Nt_804"><sup>[804]</sup></a> that this may constantly be observed
  with monstrosities <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page321"></a>{321}</span>in the animal kingdom; and Moquin-Tandon<a
  name="NtA_805" href="#Nt_805"><sup>[805]</sup></a> remarks, that, as with
  plants the axis cannot become monstrous without in some way affecting the
  organs subsequently produced from it, so axial anomalies are almost
  always accompanied by deviations of structure in the appended parts. We
  shall presently see that with short-muzzled races of the dog certain
  histological changes in the basal elements of the bones arrest their
  development and shorten them, and this affects the position of the
  subsequently developed molar teeth. It is probable that certain
  modifications in the larvæ of insects would affect the structure of the
  mature insects. But we must be very careful not to extend this view too
  far, for, during the normal course of development, certain members in the
  same group of animals are known to pass through an extraordinary course
  of change, whilst other and closely allied members arrive at maturity
  with little change of structure.</p>

  <p>Another simple case of correlation is that with the increased or
  decreased dimensions of the whole body, or of any particular part,
  certain organs are increased or diminished in number, or are otherwise
  modified. Thus pigeon-fanciers have gone on selecting pouters for length
  of body, and we have seen that their vertebræ are generally increased in
  number, and their ribs in breadth. Tumblers have been selected for their
  small bodies, and their ribs and primary wing-feathers are generally
  lessened in number. Fantails have been selected for their large,
  widely-expanded tails, with numerous tail-feathers, and the caudal
  vertebræ are increased in size and number. Carriers have been selected
  for length of beak, and their tongues have become longer, but not in
  strict accordance with the length of beak. In this latter breed and in
  others having large feet, the number of the scutellæ on the toes is
  greater than in the breeds with small feet. Many similar cases could be
  given. In Germany it has been observed that the period of gestation is
  longer in large-sized than in small-sized breeds of cattle. With our
  highly-improved animals of all kinds the period of maturity has advanced,
  both with respect to the full growth of the body and the period of
  reproduction; and, in correspondence with this, the teeth are now
  developed earlier than formerly, so that, <!-- Page 322 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>{322}</span>to the surprise of
  agriculturists, the ancient rules for judging the age of an animal by the
  state of its teeth are no longer trustworthy.<a name="NtA_806"
  href="#Nt_806"><sup>[806]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Correlated Variation of Homologous Parts.</i>&mdash;Parts which are
  homologous tend to vary in the same manner; and this is what might have
  been expected, for such parts are identical in form and structure during
  an early period of embryonic development, and are exposed in the egg or
  womb to similar conditions. The symmetry, in most kinds of animals, of
  the corresponding or homologous organs on the right and left sides of the
  body, is the simplest case in point; but this symmetry sometimes fails,
  as with rabbits having only one ear, or stags with one horn, or with
  many-horned sheep which sometimes carry an additional horn on one side of
  their heads. With flowers which have regular corollas, the petals
  generally vary in the same manner, as we see in the same complicated and
  elegant pattern, on the flowers of the Chinese pink; but with irregular
  flowers, though the petals are of course homologous, this symmetry often
  fails, as with the varieties of the <i>Antirrhinum</i> or snapdragon, or
  that variety of the kidney-bean (<i>Phaseolus multiflorus</i>) which has
  a white standard-petal.</p>

  <p>In the vertebrata the front and hind limbs are homologous, and they
  tend to vary in the same manner, as we see in long and short-legged, or
  in thick and thin-legged races of the horse and dog. Isidore Geoffroy<a
  name="NtA_807" href="#Nt_807"><sup>[807]</sup></a> has remarked on the
  tendency of supernumerary digits in man to appear, not only on the right
  and left sides, but on the upper and lower extremities. Meckel has
  insisted<a name="NtA_808" href="#Nt_808"><sup>[808]</sup></a> that, when
  the muscles of the arm depart in number or arrangement from their proper
  type, they almost always imitate those of the leg; and so conversely the
  varying muscles of the leg imitate the normal muscles of the arm.</p>

  <p>In several distinct breeds of the pigeon and fowl, the legs and the
  two outer toes are heavily feathered, so that in the trumpeter pigeon
  they appear like little wings. In the feather-legged bantam the "boots"
  or feathers, which grow from the outside of the leg and generally from
  the two outer toes, have, <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page323"></a>{323}</span>according to the excellent authority of
  Mr. Hewitt,<a name="NtA_809" href="#Nt_809"><sup>[809]</sup></a> been
  seen to exceed the wing-feathers in length, and in one case were actually
  nine and a half inches in length! As Mr. Blyth has remarked to me, these
  leg-feathers resemble the primary wing-feathers, and are totally unlike
  the fine down which naturally grows on the legs of some birds, such as
  grouse and owls. Hence it may be suspected that excess of food has first
  given redundancy to the plumage, and then that the law of homologous
  variation has led to the development of feathers on the legs, in a
  position corresponding with those on the wing, namely, on the outside of
  the tarsi and toes. I am strengthened in this belief by the following
  curious case of correlation, which for a long time seemed to me utterly
  inexplicable, namely, that in pigeons of any breed, if the legs are
  feathered, the two outer toes are partially connected by skin. These two
  outer toes correspond with our third and fourth toes. Now, in the wing of
  the pigeon or any other bird, the first and fifth digits are wholly
  aborted; the second is rudimentary and carries the so-called
  "bastard-wing;" whilst the third and fourth digits are completely united
  and enclosed by skin, together forming the extremity of the wing. So that
  in feather-footed pigeons, not only does the exterior surface support a
  row of long feathers, like wing-feathers, but the very same digits which
  in the wing are completely united by skin become partially united by skin
  in the feet; and thus by the law of the correlated variation of
  homologous parts we can understand the curious connection of feathered
  legs and membrane between the two outer toes.</p>

  <p>Andrew Knight<a name="NtA_810" href="#Nt_810"><sup>[810]</sup></a> has
  remarked that the face or head and the limbs vary together in general
  proportions. Compare, for instance, the head and limbs of a dray and
  race-horse, or of a greyhound and mastiff. What a monster a greyhound
  would appear with the head of a mastiff! The <i>modern</i> bulldog,
  however, has fine limbs, but this is a recently-selected character. From
  the measurements given in the sixth chapter, we clearly see that in all
  the breeds of the pigeon the length of the beak and the size of the feet
  are correlated. The view which, as before explained, seems the most
  probable is, that disuse in all cases tends <!-- Page 324 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page324"></a>{324}</span>to diminish the feet,
  the beak becoming at the same time through correlation shorter; but that
  in those few breeds in which length of beak has been a selected point,
  the feet, notwithstanding disuse, have through correlation increased in
  size.</p>

  <p>With the increased length of the beak in pigeons, not only the tongue
  increases in length, but likewise the orifice of the nostrils. But the
  increased length of the orifice of the nostrils perhaps stands in closer
  correlation with the development of the corrugated skin or wattle at the
  base of the beak; for when there is much wattle round the eyes, the
  eyelids are greatly increased or even doubled in length.</p>

  <p>There is apparently some correlation even in colour between the head
  and the extremities. Thus with horses a large white star or blaze on the
  forehead is generally accompanied by white feet.<a name="NtA_811"
  href="#Nt_811"><sup>[811]</sup></a> With white rabbits and cattle, dark
  marks often co-exist on the tips of the ears and on the feet. In black
  and tan dogs of different breeds, tan-coloured spots over the eyes and
  tan-coloured feet almost invariably go together. These latter cases of
  connected colouring may be due either to reversion or to analogous
  variation,&mdash;subjects to which we shall hereafter return,&mdash;but
  this does not necessarily determine the question of their original
  correlation. If those naturalists are correct who maintain that the
  jaw-bones are homologous with the limb-bones, then we can understand why
  the head and limbs tend to vary together in shape and even in colour; but
  several highly competent judges dispute the correctness of this view.</p>

  <p>The lopping forwards and downwards of the immense ears of fancy
  rabbits is in part due to the disuse of the muscles, and in part to the
  weight and length of the ears, which have been increased by selection
  during many generations. Now, with the increased size and changed
  direction of the ears, not only has the bony auditory meatus become
  changed in outline, direction, and greatly in size, but the whole skull
  has been slightly modified. This could be clearly seen in
  "half-lops"&mdash;that is, in rabbits with one ear alone lopping
  forward&mdash;for the opposite sides of their skulls were not strictly
  symmetrical. This seems to me a curious instance of correlation, between
  hard <!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page325"></a>{325}</span>bones and organs so soft and flexible, as
  well as so unimportant under a physiological point of view, as the
  external ears. The result no doubt is largely due to mere mechanical
  action, that is, to the weight of the ears, on the same principle that
  the skull of a human infant is easily modified by pressure.</p>

  <p>The skin and the appendages of hair, feathers, hoofs, horns, and
  teeth, are homologous over the whole body. Every one knows that the
  colour of the skin and that of the hair usually vary together; so that
  Virgil advises the shepherd to look whether the mouth and tongue of the
  ram are black, lest the lambs should not be purely white. With poultry
  and certain ducks we have seen that the colour of the plumage stands in
  some connexion with the colour of the shell of the egg,&mdash;that is,
  with the mucous membrane which secretes the shell. The colour of the skin
  and hair, and the odour emitted by the glands of the skin, are said<a
  name="NtA_812" href="#Nt_812"><sup>[812]</sup></a> to be connected, even
  in the same race of men. Generally the hair varies in the same way all
  over the body in length, fineness, and curliness. The same rule holds
  good with feathers, as we see with the laced and frizzled breeds both of
  fowls and pigeons. In the common cock the feathers on the neck and loins
  are always of a particular shape, called hackles: now in the Polish
  breed, both sexes are characterised by a tuft of feathers on the head;
  but through correlation these feathers in the male always assume the form
  of hackles. The wing and tail-feathers, though arising from parts not
  homologous, vary in length together; so that long or short winged pigeons
  generally have long or short tails. The case of the Jacobin-pigeon is
  more curious, for the wing and tail feathers are remarkably long; and
  this apparently has arisen in correlation with the elongated and reversed
  feathers on the back of the neck, which form the hood.</p>

  <p>The hoofs and hair are homologous appendages; and a careful observer,
  namely Azara,<a name="NtA_813" href="#Nt_813"><sup>[813]</sup></a> states
  that in Paraguay horses of various colours are often born with their hair
  curled and twisted like that on the head of a negro. This peculiarity is
  strongly inherited. But what is remarkable is that the hoofs of these
  horses "are absolutely like those of a mule." The hair also of the mane
  and tail is invariably much shorter than usual, being only from four <!--
  Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page326"></a>{326}</span>to
  twelve inches in length; so that curliness and shortness of the hair are
  here, as with the negro, apparently correlated.</p>

  <p>With respect to the horns of sheep, Youatt<a name="NtA_814"
  href="#Nt_814"><sup>[814]</sup></a> remarks that "multiplicity of horns
  is not found in any breed of much value: it is generally accompanied by
  great length and coarseness of the fleece." Several tropical breeds of
  sheep, which are clothed with hair instead of wool, have horns almost
  like those of a goat. Sturm<a name="NtA_815"
  href="#Nt_815"><sup>[815]</sup></a> expressly declares that in different
  races the more the wool is curled the more the horns are spirally
  twisted. We have seen in the third chapter, where other analogous facts
  have been given, that the parent of the Mauchamp breed, so famous for its
  fleece, had peculiarly shaped horns. The inhabitants of Angora assert<a
  name="NtA_816" href="#Nt_816"><sup>[816]</sup></a> that "only the white
  goats which have horns wear the fleece in the long curly locks that are
  so much admired; those which are not horned having a comparatively close
  coat." From these cases we may conclude that the hair or wool and the
  horns vary in a correlated manner. Those who have tried hydropathy are
  aware that the frequent application of cold water stimulates the skin;
  and whatever stimulates the skin tends to increase the growth of the
  hair, as is well shown in the abnormal growth of hair near old inflamed
  surfaces. Now, Professor Low<a name="NtA_817"
  href="#Nt_817"><sup>[817]</sup></a> is convinced that with the different
  races of British cattle thick skin and long hair depend on the humidity
  of the climate which they inhabit. We can thus see how a humid climate
  might act on the horns&mdash;in the first place directly on the skin and
  hair, and secondly by correlation on the horns. The presence or absence
  of horns, moreover, both in the case of sheep and cattle, acts, as will
  presently be shown, by some sort of correlation on the skull.</p>

  <p>With respect to hair and teeth, Mr. Yarrell<a name="NtA_818"
  href="#Nt_818"><sup>[818]</sup></a> found many of the teeth deficient in
  three hairless "<i>Ægyptian</i>" dogs, and in a hairless terrier. The
  incisors, canines, and premolars suffered most, but in one case all the
  teeth, except the large tubercular molar on each side, were deficient.
  With man several striking cases have been recorded<a name="NtA_819"
  href="#Nt_819"><sup>[819]</sup></a> of inherited baldness with <!-- Page
  327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>{327}</span>inherited
  deficiency, either complete or partial, of the teeth. We see the same
  connexion in those rare cases in which the hair has been renewed in old
  age, for this has "usually been accompanied by a renewal of the teeth." I
  have remarked in a former part of this volume that the great reduction in
  the size of the tusks in domestic boars probably stands in close relation
  with their diminished bristles, due to a certain amount of protection;
  and that the reappearance of the tusks in boars, which have become feral
  and are fully exposed to the weather, probably depends on the
  reappearance of the bristles. I may add, though not strictly connected
  with our present point, that an agriculturist<a name="NtA_820"
  href="#Nt_820"><sup>[820]</sup></a> asserts that "pigs with little hair
  on their bodies are most liable to lose their tails, showing a weakness
  of the tegumental structure. It may be prevented by crossing with a more
  hairy breed."</p>

  <p>In the previous cases deficient hair, and teeth deficient in number or
  size, are apparently connected. In the following cases abnormally
  redundant hair, and teeth either deficient or redundant, are likewise
  connected. Mr. Crawfurd<a name="NtA_821"
  href="#Nt_821"><sup>[821]</sup></a> saw at the Burmese Court a man,
  thirty years old, with his whole body, except the hands and feet, covered
  with straight silky hair, which on the shoulders and spine was five
  inches in length. At birth the ears alone were covered. He did not arrive
  at puberty, or shed his milk teeth, until twenty years old; and at this
  period he acquired five teeth in the upper jaw, namely four incisors and
  one canine, and four incisor teeth in the lower jaw; all the teeth were
  small. This man had a daughter, who was born with hair within her ears;
  and the hair soon extended over her body. When Captain Yule<a
  name="NtA_822" href="#Nt_822"><sup>[822]</sup></a> visited the Court, he
  found this girl grown up; and she presented a strange appearance with
  even her nose densely covered with soft hair. Like her father, she was
  furnished with incisor teeth alone. The King had with difficulty bribed a
  man to marry her, and of her two children, one, a boy fourteen months
  old, had hair growing out of his ears, with a beard and moustache. This
  strange peculiarity had, therefore, been inherited for three generations,
  with the molar teeth deficient in the grandfather and mother; whether
  <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page328"></a>{328}</span>these teeth would likewise fail in the
  infant could not be told. Here is another case communicated to me by Mr.
  Wallace on the authority of Dr. Purland, a dentist: Julia Pastrana, a
  Spanish dancer, was a remarkably fine woman, but she had a thick
  masculine beard and a hairy forehead; she was photographed, and her
  stuffed skin was exhibited as a show; but what concerns us is, that she
  had in both the upper and lower jaw an irregular double set of teeth, one
  row being placed within the other, of which Dr. Purland took a cast. From
  the redundancy of the teeth her mouth projected, and her face had a
  gorilla-like appearance. These cases and those of the hairless dogs
  forcibly call to mind the fact, that the two orders of
  mammals&mdash;namely, the Edentata and Cetacea&mdash;which are the most
  abnormal in their dermal covering, are likewise the most abnormal either
  by deficiency or redundancy of teeth.</p>

  <p>The organs of sight and hearing are generally admitted to be
  homologous, both with each other and with the various dermal appendages;
  hence these parts are liable to be abnormally affected in conjunction.
  Mr. White Cowper says "that in all cases of double microphthalmia brought
  under his notice he has at the same time met with defective development
  of the dental system." Certain forms of blindness seem to be associated
  with the colour of the hair; a man with black hair and a woman with
  light-coloured hair, both of sound constitution, married and had nine
  children, all of whom were born blind; of these children, five "with dark
  hair and brown iris were afflicted with amaurosis; the four others, with
  light-coloured hair and blue iris, had amaurosis and cataract conjoined."
  Several cases could be given, showing that some relation exists between
  various affections of the eyes and ears; thus Liebreich states that out
  of 241 deaf-mutes in Berlin, no less than fourteen suffered from the rare
  disease called pigmentary retinitis. Mr. White Cowper and Dr. Earle have
  remarked that inability to distinguish different colours, or
  colour-blindness, "is often associated with a corresponding inability to
  distinguish musical sounds."<a name="NtA_823"

<p><!-- Page 329 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>{329}</span></p>

  <p>Here is a more curious case: white cats, if they have blue eyes, are
  almost always deaf. I formerly thought that the rule was invariable, but
  I have heard of a few authentic exceptions. The first two notices were
  published in 1829, and relate to English and Persian cats: of the latter,
  the Rev. W.&nbsp;T. Bree possessed a female, and he states "that of the
  offspring produced at one and the same birth, such as, like the mother,
  were entirely white (with blue eyes) were, like her, invariably deaf;
  while those that had the least speck of colour on their fur, as
  invariably possessed the usual faculty of hearing."<a name="NtA_824"
  href="#Nt_824"><sup>[824]</sup></a> The Rev. W. Darwin Fox informs me
  that he has seen more than a dozen instances of this correlation in
  English, Persian, and Danish cats; but he adds "that, if one eye, as I
  have several times observed, be not blue, the cat hears. On the other
  hand, I have never seen a white cat with eyes of the common colour that
  was deaf." In France Dr. Sichel<a name="NtA_825"
  href="#Nt_825"><sup>[825]</sup></a> has observed during twenty years
  similar facts; he adds the remarkable case of the iris beginning, at the
  end of four months, to grow dark-coloured, and then the cat first began
  to hear.</p>

  <p>This case of correlation in cats has struck many persons as
  marvellous. There is nothing unusual in the relation between blue eyes
  and white fur; and we have already seen that the organs of sight and
  hearing are often simultaneously affected. In the present instance the
  cause probably lies in a slight arrest of development in the nervous
  system in connection with the sense-organs. Kittens during the first nine
  days, whilst their eyes are closed, appear to be completely deaf; I have
  made a great clanging noise with a poker and shovel close to their heads,
  both when they were asleep and awake, without producing any effect. The
  trial must not be made by shouting close to their ears, for they are,
  even when asleep, extremely sensitive to a breath of air. Now, as long as
  the eyes continue closed, the iris is no doubt blue, for in all the
  kittens which I have seen this colour remains for some time after the
  eyelids open. Hence, if we suppose the development of the organs of sight
  and hearing to be arrested at the stage of the closed eyelids, the eyes
  would <!-- Page 330 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page330"></a>{330}</span>remain permanently blue and the ears would
  be incapable of perceiving sound; and we should thus understand this
  curious case. As, however, the colour of the fur is determined long
  before birth, and as the blueness of the eyes and the whiteness of the
  fur are obviously connected, we must believe that some primary cause acts
  at an early period.</p>

  <p>The instances of correlated variability hitherto given have been
  chiefly drawn from the animal kingdom, and we will now turn to plants.
  Leaves, sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils are all homologous. In
  double flowers we see that the stamens and pistils vary in the same
  manner, and assume the form and colour of the petals. In the double
  columbine (<i>Aquilegia vulgaris</i>), the successive whorls of stamens
  are converted into cornucopias, which are enclosed within each other and
  resemble the petals. In hose-and-hose flowers the sepals mock the petals.
  In some cases the flowers and leaves vary together in tint: in all the
  varieties of the common pea, which have purple flowers, a purple mark may
  be seen on the stipules. In other cases the leaves and fruit and seeds
  vary together in colour, as in a curious pale-leaved variety of the
  sycamore, which has recently been described in France,<a name="NtA_826"
  href="#Nt_826"><sup>[826]</sup></a> and as in the purple-leaved hazel, in
  which the leaves, the husk of the nut, and the pellicle round the kernel
  are all coloured purple.<a name="NtA_827"
  href="#Nt_827"><sup>[827]</sup></a> Pomologists can predict to a certain
  extent, from the size and appearance of the leaves of their seedlings,
  the probable nature of the fruit; for, as Van Mons remarks,<a
  name="NtA_828" href="#Nt_828"><sup>[828]</sup></a> variations in the
  leaves are generally accompanied by some modification in the flower, and
  consequently in the fruit. In the Serpent melon, which has a narrow
  tortuous fruit above a yard in length, the stem of the plant, the
  peduncle of the female flower, and the middle lobe of the leaf, are all
  elongated in a remarkable manner. On the other hand, several varieties of
  Cucurbita, which have dwarfed stems, all produce, as Naudin remarks with
  surprise, leaves of the same peculiar shape. Mr. G. Maw informs me that
  all the varieties of the scarlet Pelargoniums which have contracted or
  imperfect leaves have contracted flowers: the difference between <!--
  Page 331 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page331"></a>{331}</span>"Brilliant" and its parent "Tom Thumb" is
  a good instance of this. It may be suspected that the curious case
  described by Risso,<a name="NtA_829" href="#Nt_829"><sup>[829]</sup></a>
  of a variety of the Orange which produces on the young shoots rounded
  leaves with winged petioles, and afterwards elongated leaves on long but
  wingless petioles, is connected with the remarkable change in form and
  nature which the fruit undergoes during its development.</p>

  <p>In the following instance we have the colour and form of the petals
  apparently correlated, and both dependent on the nature of the season. An
  observer, skilled in the subject, writes,<a name="NtA_830"
  href="#Nt_830"><sup>[830]</sup></a> "I noticed, during the year 1842,
  that every Dahlia, of which the colour had any tendency to scarlet, was
  deeply notched&mdash;indeed to so great an extent as to give the petals
  the appearance of a saw; the indentures were, in some instances, more
  than a quarter of an inch deep." Again, Dahlias which have their petals
  tipped with a different colour from the rest are very inconstant, and
  during certain years some, or even all the flowers, become uniformly
  coloured; and it has been observed with several varieties,<a
  name="NtA_831" href="#Nt_831"><sup>[831]</sup></a> that when this happens
  the petals grow much elongated and lose their proper shape. This,
  however, may be due to reversion, both in colour and form, to the
  aboriginal species.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In this discussion on correlation, we have hitherto treated of cases
  in which we can partly understand the bond of connexion; but I will now
  give cases in which we cannot even conjecture, or can only very obscurely
  see, what is the nature of the bond. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire, in his
  work on Monstrosities, insists,<a name="NtA_832"
  href="#Nt_832"><sup>[832]</sup></a> "que certaines anomalies coexistent
  rarement entr'elles, d'autres fréquemment, d'autres enfin presque
  constamment, malgré la différence très-grande de leur nature, et
  quoiqu'elles puissent paraître <i>complètement indépendantes</i> les unes
  des autres." We see something analogous in certain diseases: thus I hear
  from Mr. Paget that in a rare affection of the <!-- Page 332 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>{332}</span>renal capsules (of
  which the functions are unknown), the skin becomes bronzed; and in
  hereditary syphilis, both the milk and the second teeth assume a peculiar
  and characteristic form. Professor Rolleston, also, informs me that the
  incisor teeth are sometimes furnished with a vascular rim in correlation
  with intra-pulmonary deposition of tubercles. In other cases of phthisis
  and of cyanosis the nails and finger-ends become clubbed like acorns. I
  believe that no explanation has been offered of these and of many other
  cases of correlated disease.</p>

  <p>What can be more curious and less intelligible than the fact
  previously given, on the authority of Mr. Tegetmeier, that young pigeons
  of all breeds, which when mature have white, yellow, silver-blue, or
  dun-coloured plumage, come out of the egg almost naked; whereas pigeons
  of other colours when first born are clothed with plenty of down? White
  Pea-fowls, as has been observed both in England and France,<a
  name="NtA_833" href="#Nt_833"><sup>[833]</sup></a> and as I have myself
  seen, are inferior in size to the common coloured kind; and this cannot
  be accounted for by the belief that albinism is always accompanied by
  constitutional weakness; for white or albino moles are generally larger
  than the common kind.</p>

  <p>To turn to more important characters: the niata cattle of the Pampas
  are remarkable from their short foreheads, upturned muzzles, and curved
  lower jaws. In the skull the nasal and premaxillary bones are much
  shortened, the maxillaries are excluded from any junction with the
  nasals, and all the bones are slightly modified, even to the plane of the
  occiput. From the analogical case of the dog, hereafter to be given, it
  is probable that the shortening of the nasal and adjoining bones is the
  proximate cause of the other modifications in the skull, including the
  upward curvature of the lower jaw, though we cannot follow out the steps
  by which these changes have been effected.</p>

  <p>Polish fowls have a large tuft of feathers on their heads; and their
  skulls are perforated by numerous holes, so that a pin can be driven into
  the brain without touching any bone. That this deficiency of bone is in
  some way connected with the tuft of feathers is clear from tufted ducks
  and geese likewise having <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page333"></a>{333}</span>perforated skulls. The case would probably
  be considered by some authors as one of balancement or compensation. In
  the chapter on Fowls, I have shown that with Polish fowls the tuft of
  feathers was probably at first small; by continued selection it became
  larger, and then rested on a fleshy or fibrous mass; and finally, as it
  became still larger, the skull itself became more and more protuberant
  until it acquired its present extraordinary structure. Through
  correlation with the protuberance of the skull, the shape and even the
  relative connexion of the premaxillary and nasal bones, the shape of the
  orifice of the nostrils, the breadth of the frontal bone, the shape of
  the post-lateral processes of the frontal and squamosal bones, and the
  direction of the bony cavity of the ear, have all been modified. The
  internal configuration of the skull and the whole shape of the brain have
  likewise been altered in a truly marvellous manner.</p>

  <p>After this case of the Polish fowl it would be superfluous to do more
  than refer to the details previously given on the manner in which the
  changed form of the comb, in various breeds of the fowl, has affected the
  skull, causing by correlation crests, protuberances, and depressions on
  its surface.</p>

  <p>With our cattle and sheep the horns stand in close connexion with the
  size of the skull, and with the shape of the frontal bones; thus Cline<a
  name="NtA_834" href="#Nt_834"><sup>[834]</sup></a> found that the skull
  of a horned ram weighed five times as much as that of a hornless ram of
  the same age. When cattle become hornless, the frontal bones are
  "materially diminished in breadth towards the poll;" and the cavities
  between the bony plates "are not so deep, nor do they extend beyond the
  frontals."<a name="NtA_835" href="#Nt_835"><sup>[835]</sup></a></p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It may be well here to pause and observe how the effects of correlated
  variability, of the increased use of parts, and of the accumulation
  through natural selection of so-called spontaneous variations, are in
  many cases inextricably commingled. We may borrow an illustration from
  Mr. Herbert Spencer, who remarks that, when the Irish elk acquired its
  gigantic horns, weighing above one hundred pounds, numerous co-ordinated
  <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page334"></a>{334}</span>changes of structure would have been
  indispensable,&mdash;namely, a thickened skull to carry the horns;
  strengthened cervical vertebræ, with strengthened ligaments; enlarged
  dorsal vertebræ to support the neck, with powerful fore-legs and feet;
  all these parts being supplied with proper muscles, blood-vessels, and
  nerves. How then could these admirably co-ordinated modifications of
  structure have been acquired? According to the doctrine which I maintain,
  the horns of the male elk were slowly gained through sexual
  selection,&mdash;that is, by the best-armed males conquering the
  worse-armed, and leaving a greater number of descendants. But it is not
  at all necessary that the several parts of the body should have
  simultaneously varied. Each stag presents individual differences, and in
  the same district those which had slightly heavier horns, or stronger
  necks, or stronger bodies, or were the most courageous, would secure the
  greater number of does, and consequently leave a greater number of
  offspring. The offspring would inherit, in a greater or less degree,
  these same qualities, would occasionally intercross with each other, or
  with other individuals varying in some favourable manner; and of their
  offspring, those which were the best endowed in any respect would
  continue multiplying; and so onwards, always progressing, sometimes in
  one direction, and sometimes in another, towards the present excellently
  co-ordinated structure of the male elk. To make this clear, let us
  reflect on the probable steps, as shown in the twentieth chapter, by
  which our race and dray-horses have arrived at their present state of
  excellence; if we could view the whole series of intermediate forms
  between one of these animals and an early unimproved progenitor, we
  should behold a vast number of animals, not equally improved in each
  generation throughout their entire structure, but sometimes a little more
  in one point, and sometimes in another, yet on the whole gradually
  approaching in character to our present race or dray-horses, which are so
  admirably fitted in the one case for fleetness and in the other for
  draught.</p>

  <p>Although natural selection would thus<a name="NtA_836"
  href="#Nt_836"><sup>[836]</sup></a> tend to give to the <!-- Page 335
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335"></a>{335}</span>male elk its
  present structure, yet it is probable that the inherited influence of use
  has played an equal or more important part. As the horns gradually
  increased in weight, the muscles of the neck, with the bones to which
  they are attached, would increase in size and strength; and these parts
  would react on the body and legs. Nor must we overlook the fact that
  certain parts of the skull and the extremities would, judging by analogy,
  tend from the first to vary in a correlated manner. The increased weight
  of the horns would also act directly on the skull, in the same manner as,
  when one bone is removed in the leg of a dog, the other bone, which has
  to carry the whole weight of the body, increases in thickness. But from
  the facts given with respect to horned and hornless cattle, it is
  probable that the horns and skull would immediately act on each other
  through the principle of correlation. Lastly, the growth and subsequent
  wear and tear of the augmented muscles and bones would require an
  increased supply of blood, and consequently an increased supply of food;
  and this again would require increased powers of mastication, digestion,
  respiration, and excretion.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Colour as Correlated with Constitutional Peculiarities.</i></p>

  <p>It is an old belief that with man there is a connexion between
  complexion and constitution; and I find that some of the best authorities
  believe in this to the present day.<a name="NtA_837"
  href="#Nt_837"><sup>[837]</sup></a> Thus Dr. Beddoe by his tables shows<a
  name="NtA_838" href="#Nt_838"><sup>[838]</sup></a> that a relation exists
  between liability to consumption and the colour of the hair, eyes, and
  skin. It has been affirmed<a name="NtA_839"
  href="#Nt_839"><sup>[839]</sup></a> that, in the French army which
  invaded Russia, soldiers having a dark complexion, from the <!-- Page 336
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page336"></a>{336}</span>southern parts
  of Europe, withstood the intense cold better than those with lighter
  complexions from the north; but no doubt such statements are liable to
  error.</p>

  <p>In the second chapter on Selection I have given several cases proving
  that with animals and plants differences in colour are correlated with
  constitutional differences, as shown by greater or less immunity from
  certain diseases, from the attacks of parasitic plants and animals, from
  burning by the sun, and from the action of certain poisons. When all the
  individuals of any one variety possess an immunity of this nature, we
  cannot feel sure that it stands in any sort of correlation with their
  colour; but when several varieties of the same species, which are
  similarly coloured, are thus characterised, whilst other coloured
  varieties are not thus favoured, we must believe in the existence of a
  correlation of this kind. Thus in the United States purple-fruited plums
  of many kinds are far more affected by a certain disease than green or
  yellow-fruited varieties. On the other hand, yellow-fleshed peaches of
  various kinds suffer from another disease much more than the
  white-fleshed varieties. In the Mauritius red sugar-canes are much less
  affected by a particular disease than the white canes. White onions and
  verbenas are the most liable to mildew; and in Spain the green-fruited
  grapes suffered from the vine-disease more than other coloured varieties.
  Dark-coloured pelargoniums and verbenas are more scorched by the sun than
  varieties of other colours. Red wheats are believed to be hardier than
  white; whilst red-flowered hyacinths were more injured during one
  particular winter in Holland than other coloured varieties. With animals,
  white terriers suffer most from the distemper, white chickens from a
  parasitic worm in their tracheæ, white pigs from scorching by the sun,
  and white cattle from flies; but the caterpillars of the silk-moth which
  yield white cocoons suffered in France less from the deadly parasitic
  fungus than those producing yellow silk.</p>

  <p>The cases of immunity from the action of certain vegetable poisons, in
  connexion with colour, are more interesting, and are at present wholly
  inexplicable. I have already given a remarkable instance, on the
  authority of Professor Wyman, of all the hogs, excepting those of a black
  colour, suffering severely in Virginia from eating the root of the
  <i>Lachnanthes tinctoria</i>. <!-- Page 337 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page337"></a>{337}</span>According to Spinola and others,<a
  name="NtA_840" href="#Nt_840"><sup>[840]</sup></a> buckwheat
  (<i>Polygonum fagopyrum</i>), when in flower, is highly injurious to
  white or white-spotted pigs, if they are exposed to the heat of the sun,
  but is quite innocuous to black pigs. By two accounts, the <i>Hypericum
  crispum</i> in Sicily is poisonous to white sheep alone; their heads
  swell, their wool falls off, and they often die; but this plant,
  according to Lecce, is poisonous only when it grows in swamps; nor is
  this improbable, as we know how readily the poisonous principle in plants
  is influenced by the conditions under which they grow.</p>

  <p>Three accounts have been published in Eastern Prussia, of white and
  white-spotted horses being greatly injured by eating mildewed and
  honeydewed vetches; every spot of skin bearing white hairs becoming
  inflamed and gangrenous. The Rev. J. Rodwell informs me that his father
  turned out about fifteen cart-horses into a field of tares which in parts
  swarmed with black aphides, and which no doubt were honeydewed, and
  probably mildewed; the horses, with two exceptions, were chesnuts and
  bays with white marks on their faces and pasterns, and the white parts
  alone swelled and became angry scabs. The two bay horses with no white
  marks entirely escaped all injury. In Guernsey, when horses eat fools'
  parsley (<i>Æthusa cynapium</i>) they are sometimes violently purged; and
  this plant "has a peculiar effect on the nose and lips, causing deep
  cracks and ulcers, particularly on horses with white muzzles."<a
  name="NtA_841" href="#Nt_841"><sup>[841]</sup></a> With cattle,
  independently of the action of any poison, cases have been published by
  Youatt and Erdt of cutaneous diseases with much constitutional
  disturbance (in one instance after exposure to a hot sun) affecting every
  single point which bore a white hair, but completely passing over other
  parts of the body. Similar cases have been observed with horses.<a
  name="NtA_842" href="#Nt_842"><sup>[842]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We thus see that not only do those parts of the skin which bear white
  hair differ in a remarkable manner from those bearing <!-- Page 338
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page338"></a>{338}</span>hair of any
  other colour, but that in addition some great, constitutional difference
  must stand in correlation with the colour of the hair; for in the
  above-mentioned cases, vegetable poisons caused fever, swelling of the
  head, as well as other symptoms, and even death, to all the white or
  white-spotted animals.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>On the Affinity of Homologous Parts.</i>&mdash;This law was first
  generalised by Geoffroy Saint Hilaire, under the expression of <i>La loi
  de l'affinité de soi pour soi</i>. It has been fully discussed and
  illustrated by his son, Isidore Geoffroy, with respect to monsters in the
  animal kingdom,<a name="NtA_843" href="#Nt_843"><sup>[843]</sup></a> and
  by Moquin-Tandon, with respect to monstrous plants. When similar or
  homologous parts, whether belonging to the same embryo or to two distinct
  embryos, are brought during an early stage of development into contact,
  they often blend into a single part or organ; and this complete fusion
  indicates some mutual affinity between the parts, otherwise they would
  simply cohere. Whether any power exists which tends to bring homologous
  parts into contact seems more doubtful. The tendency to complete fusion
  is not a rare or exceptional fact. It is exhibited in the most striking
  manner by double monsters. Nothing can be more extraordinary than the
  manner, as shown in various published plates, in which the corresponding
  parts of two embryos become intimately fused together. This is perhaps
  best seen in monsters with two heads, which are united, summit to summit,
  or face to face, or, Janus-like, back to back, or obliquely side to side.
  In one instance of two heads united almost face to face, but a little
  obliquely, four ears were developed, and on one side a perfect face,
  which was manifestly formed by the union of two <!-- Page 340 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>{340}</span>half-faces. Whenever
  two bodies or two heads are united, each bone, muscle, vessel, and nerve
  on the line of junction seems to seek out its fellow, and becomes
  completely fused with it. Lereboullet,<a name="NtA_844"
  href="#Nt_844"><sup>[844]</sup></a> who carefully studied the development
  of double monsters in fishes, observed in fifteen instances the steps by
  which two heads gradually became fused into one. In this and other such
  cases, no one, I presume, supposes that the two already formed heads
  actually blend together, but that the corresponding parts of each head
  grow into one during the further progress of development, accompanied as
  it always is with incessant absorption and renovation. Double monsters
  were formerly thought to be formed by the union of two originally
  distinct embryos developed upon distinct vitelli; but now it is admitted
  that "their production is due to the spontaneous divarication of the
  embryonic mass into two halves;"<a name="NtA_845"
  href="#Nt_845"><sup>[845]</sup></a> this, however, is effected by
  different methods. But the belief that double monsters originate from the
  division of one germ, does not necessarily affect the question of
  subsequent fusion, or render less true the law of the affinity of
  homologous parts.</p>

  <p>The cautious and sagacious J. Müller,<a name="NtA_846"
  href="#Nt_846"><sup>[846]</sup></a> when speaking of Janus-like monsters,
  says, that "without the supposition that some kind of affinity or
  attraction is exerted between corresponding parts, unions of this kind
  are inexplicable." On the other hand, Vrolik, and he is followed by
  others, disputes this conclusion, and argues from the existence of a
  whole series of monstrosities, graduating from a perfectly double monster
  to a mere rudiment of an additional digit, that "an excess of formative
  power" is the cause and origin of every monstrous duplicity. That there
  are two distinct classes of cases, and that parts may be doubled
  independently of the existence of two embryos, is certain; for a single
  embryo, or even a single adult animal, may produce doubled organs. Thus
  Valentin, as quoted by Vrolik, injured the caudal extremity of an embryo,
  and three days afterwards it produced rudiments of a double pelvis and of
  double hind limbs. <!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page341"></a>{341}</span>Hunter and others have observed lizards
  with their tails reproduced and doubled. When Bonnet divided
  longitudinally the foot of the salamander, several additional digits were
  occasionally formed. But neither these cases, nor the perfect series from
  a double monster to an additional digit, seem to me opposed to the belief
  that corresponding parts have a mutual affinity, and consequently tend to
  fuse together. A part may be doubled and remain in this state, or the two
  parts thus formed may afterwards through the law of affinity become
  blended; or two homologous parts in two separate embryos may, through the
  same principle, unite and form a single part.</p>

  <p>The law of the affinity and fusion of similar parts applies to the
  homologous organs of the same individual animal, as well as to double
  monsters. Isidore Geoffroy gives a number of instances of two or more
  digits, of two whole legs, of two kidneys, and of several teeth becoming
  symmetrically fused together in a more or less perfect manner. Even the
  two eyes have been known to unite into a single eye, forming a cyclopean
  monster, as have the two ears, though naturally standing so far apart. As
  Geoffroy remarks, these facts illustrate in an admirable manner the
  normal fusion of various organs which during an early embryonic period
  are double, but which afterwards always unite into a single median organ.
  Organs of this nature are generally found in a permanently double
  condition in other members of the same class. These cases of normal
  fusion appear to me to afford the strongest support in favour of the
  present law. Adjoining parts which are not homologous sometimes cohere;
  but this cohesion appears to result from mere juxtaposition, and not from
  mutual affinity.</p>

  <p>In the vegetable kingdom Moquin-Tandon<a name="NtA_847"
  href="#Nt_847"><sup>[847]</sup></a> gives a long list of cases, showing
  how frequently homologous parts, such as leaves, petals, stamens, and
  pistils, as well as aggregates of homologous parts, such as buds,
  flowers, and fruit, become blended into each other with perfect symmetry.
  It is interesting to examine a compound flower of this nature, formed of
  exactly double the proper number of sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils,
  with each whorl of organs circular, and with no trace left of the <!--
  Page 342 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page342"></a>{342}</span>process of fusion. The tendency in
  homologous parts to unite during their early development, Moquin-Tandon
  considers as one of the most striking laws governing the production of
  monsters. It apparently explains a multitude of cases, both in the animal
  and vegetable kingdoms; it throws a clear light on many normal structures
  which have evidently been formed by the union of originally distinct
  parts, and it possesses, as we shall see in a future chapter, much
  theoretical interest.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>On the Variability of Multiple and Homologous
  Parts.</i>&mdash;Isidore Geoffroy<a name="NtA_848"
  href="#Nt_848"><sup>[848]</sup></a> insists that, when any part or organ
  is repeated many times in the same animal, it is particularly liable to
  vary both in number and structure. With respect to number, the
  proposition may, I think, be considered as fully established; but the
  evidence is chiefly derived from organic beings living under their
  natural conditions, with which we are not here concerned. When the
  vertebræ, or teeth, or rays in the fins of fishes, or feathers in the
  tails of birds, or petals, stamens, pistils, and seeds in plants, are
  very numerous, the number is generally variable. The explanation of this
  simple fact is by no means obvious. With respect to the variability in
  structure of multiple parts, the evidence is not so decisive; but the
  fact, as far as it may be trusted, probably depends on multiple parts
  being of less physiological importance than single parts; consequently
  their perfect standard of structure has been less rigorously enforced by
  natural selection.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Compensation of Growth, or Balancement.</i>&mdash;This law, as
  applied to natural species, was propounded by Goethe and Geoffroy St.
  Hilaire at nearly the same time. It implies that, when much organised
  matter is used in building up some one part, other parts are starved and
  become reduced. Several authors, especially botanists, believe in this
  law; others reject it. As far as I can judge, it occasionally holds good;
  but its importance has probably been exaggerated. It is scarcely possible
  to distinguish between the supposed effects of such compensation of
  growth, and the effects of long-continued selection, which <!-- Page 343
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page343"></a>{343}</span>may at the
  same time lead to the augmentation of one part and the diminution of
  another. There can be no doubt that an organ may be greatly increased
  without any corresponding diminution in the adjoining parts. To recur to
  our former illustration of the Irish elk, it may be asked what part has
  suffered in consequence of the immense development of the horns?</p>

  <p>It has already been observed that the struggle for existence does not
  bear hard on our domesticated productions; consequently the principle of
  economy of growth will seldom affect them, and we ought not to expect to
  find frequent evidence of compensation. We have, however, some such
  cases. Moquin-Tandon describes a monstrous bean,<a name="NtA_849"
  href="#Nt_849"><sup>[849]</sup></a> in which the stipules were enormously
  developed, and the leaflets apparently in consequence completely aborted;
  this case is interesting, as it represents the natural condition of
  <i>Lathyrus aphaca</i>, with its stipules of great size, and its leaves
  reduced to mere threads, which act as tendrils. De Candolle<a
  name="NtA_850" href="#Nt_850"><sup>[850]</sup></a> has remarked that the
  varieties of <i>Raphanus sativus</i> which have small roots yield
  numerous seed, valuable from containing oil, whilst those with large
  roots are not productive in this latter respect; and so it is with
  <i>Brassica asperifolia</i>. The varieties of the potato which produce
  tubers very early in the season rarely bear flowers; but Andrew Knight,<a
  name="NtA_851" href="#Nt_851"><sup>[851]</sup></a> by checking the growth
  of the tubers, forced the plants to flower. The varieties of <i>Cucurbita
  pepo</i> which produce large fruit yield, according to Naudin, few in
  number; whilst those producing small fruit yield a vast number. Lastly, I
  have endeavoured to show in the eighteenth chapter that with many
  cultivated plants unnatural treatment checks the full and proper action
  of the reproductive organs, and they are thus rendered more or less
  sterile; consequently, in the way of compensation, the fruit becomes
  greatly enlarged, and, in double flowers, the petals are greatly
  increased in number.</p>

  <p>With animals, it has been found difficult to produce cows which should
  first yield much milk, and afterwards be capable of <!-- Page 344
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344"></a>{344}</span>fattening
  well. With fowls which have large topknots and beards the comb and
  wattles are generally much reduced in size. Perhaps the entire absence of
  the oil-gland in fantail pigeons may be connected with the great
  development of their tails.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Mechanical Pressure as a Cause of Modifications.</i>&mdash;In some
  few cases there is reason to believe that mere mechanical pressure has
  affected certain structures. Every one knows that savages alter the shape
  of their infants' skulls by pressure at an early age; but there is no
  reason to believe that the result is ever inherited. Nevertheless Vrolik
  and Weber<a name="NtA_852" href="#Nt_852"><sup>[852]</sup></a> maintain
  that the shape of the human head is influenced by the shape of the
  mother's pelvis. The kidneys in different birds differ much in form, and
  St. Ange<a name="NtA_853" href="#Nt_853"><sup>[853]</sup></a> believes
  that this is determined by the form of the pelvis, which again, no doubt,
  stands in close relation with their various habits of locomotion. In
  snakes, the viscera are curiously displaced, in comparison with their
  position in other vertebrates; and this has been attributed by some
  authors to the elongation of their bodies; but here, as in so many
  previous cases, it is impossible to disentangle any direct result of this
  kind from that consequent on natural selection. Godron has argued<a
  name="NtA_854" href="#Nt_854"><sup>[854]</sup></a> that the normal
  abortion of the spur on the inner side of the flower in Corydalis, is
  caused by the buds being closely pressed at a very early period of
  growth, whilst under ground, against each other and against the stem.
  Some botanists believe that the singular difference in the shape both of
  the seed and corolla, in the interior and exterior florets in certain
  compositous and umbelliferous plants, is due to the pressure to which the
  inner florets are subjected; but this conclusion is doubtful.</p>

  <p>The facts just given do not relate to domesticated productions, and
  therefore do not strictly concern us. But here is a more appropriate
  case: H. Müller<a name="NtA_855" href="#Nt_855"><sup>[855]</sup></a> has
  shown that in <!-- Page 345 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page345"></a>{345}</span>short-faced races of the dog some of the
  molar teeth are placed in a slightly different position from that which
  they occupy in other dogs, especially in those having elongated muzzles;
  and as he remarks, any inherited change in the arrangement of the teeth
  deserves notice, considering their classificatory importance. This
  difference in position is due to the shortening of certain facial bones,
  and the consequent want of space; and the shortening results from a
  peculiar and abnormal state of the basal cartilages of the bones.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Relative Position of Flowers with respect to the Axis, and of Seeds
in the Capsule, as inducing Variation.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>In the thirteenth chapter various peloric flowers were described, and
  their production was shown to be due either to arrested development, or
  to reversion to a primordial condition. Moquin-Tandon has remarked that
  the flowers which stand on the summit of the main stem or of a lateral
  branch are more liable to become peloric than those on the sides;<a
  name="NtA_856" href="#Nt_856"><sup>[856]</sup></a> and he adduces,
  amongst other instances, that of <i>Teucrium campanulatum</i>. In another
  Labiate plant grown by me, viz. the <i>Galeobdolon luteum</i>, the
  peloric flowers were always produced on the summit of the stem, where
  flowers are not usually borne. In Pelargonium, a <i>single</i> flower in
  the truss is frequently peloric, and when this occurs I have during
  several years invariably observed it to be the central flower. This is of
  such frequent occurrence that one observer<a name="NtA_857"
  href="#Nt_857"><sup>[857]</sup></a> gives the names of ten varieties
  flowering at the same time, in every one of which the central flower was
  peloric. Occasionally more than one flower in the truss is peloric, and
  then of course the additional ones must be lateral. These flowers are
  interesting as showing how the whole structure is correlated. In the
  common Pelargonium the upper sepal is produced into a nectary which
  coheres with the flower-peduncle; the two upper petals differ a little in
  shape from the three lower ones, and are marked with dark shades of
  colour; the stamens are graduated in length and upturned. In the peloric
  flowers, the nectary aborts; all the petals become alike both in shape
  and colour; the stamens are generally reduced in number and become
  straight, so that the whole flower resembles that of the allied genus
  Erodium. The correlation between these changes is well shown when one of
  the two upper petals alone loses its dark mark, for in this case the
  nectary does not entirely abort, but is usually much reduced in length.<a
  name="NtA_858" href="#Nt_858"><sup>[858]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"></a>{346}</span></p>

  <p>Morren has described<a name="NtA_859"
  href="#Nt_859"><sup>[859]</sup></a> a marvellous flask-shaped flower of
  the Calceolaria, nearly four inches in length, which was almost
  completely peloric; it grew on the summit of the plant, with a normal
  flower on each side; Prof. Westwood also has described<a name="NtA_860"
  href="#Nt_860"><sup>[860]</sup></a> three similar peloric flowers, which
  all occupied a central position on the flower-branches. In the Orchideous
  genus, Phalænopsis, the terminal flower has been seen to become
  peloric.</p>

  <p>In a Laburnum-tree I observed that about a fourth part of the racemes
  produced terminal flowers which had lost their papilionaceous structure.
  These were produced after almost all the other flowers on the same
  racemes had withered. The most perfectly pelorised examples had six
  petals, each marked with black striæ like those on the standard-petal.
  The keel seemed to resist the change more than the other petals.
  Dutrochet has described<a name="NtA_861"
  href="#Nt_861"><sup>[861]</sup></a> an exactly similar case in France,
  and I believe these are the only two instances of pelorism in the
  laburnum which have been recorded. Dutrochet remarks that the racemes on
  this tree do not properly produce a terminal flower, so that, as in the
  case of the Galeobdolon, their position as well as their structure are
  both anomalies, which no doubt are in some manner related. Dr. Masters
  has briefly described another leguminous plant,<a name="NtA_862"
  href="#Nt_862"><sup>[862]</sup></a> namely, a species of clover, in which
  the uppermost and central flowers were regular or had lost their
  papilionaceous structure. In some of these plants the flower-heads were
  also proliferous.</p>

  <p>Lastly, Linaria produces two kinds of peloric flowers, one having
  simple petals, and the other having them all spurred. The two forms, as
  Naudin remarks,<a name="NtA_863" href="#Nt_863"><sup>[863]</sup></a> not
  rarely occur on the same plant, but in this case the spurred form almost
  invariably stands on the summit of the spike.</p>

  <p>The tendency in the terminal or central flower to become peloric more
  frequently than other flowers, probably results from "the bud which
  stands on the end of a shoot receiving the most sap; it grows out into a
  stronger shoot than those situated lower down."<a name="NtA_864"
  href="#Nt_864"><sup>[864]</sup></a> I have discussed the connection
  between pelorism and a central position, partly because some few plants
  are known normally to produce a terminal flower different in structure
  from the lateral ones; but chiefly on account of the following case, in
  which we see a tendency to variability or to reversion connected with the
  same position. A great judge of Auriculas<a name="NtA_865"
  href="#Nt_865"><sup>[865]</sup></a> states that when an Auricula throws
  up a side bloom it is pretty sure to keep its character; but that if it
  grows from the centre or heart of the plant, whatever the colour of the
  edging ought to be, "it is just as likely to come in any other class as
  in the one to which it properly belongs." This is so notorious a <!--
  Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>{347}</span>fact,
  that some florists regularly pinch off the central trusses of flowers.
  Whether in the highly improved varieties the departure of the central
  trusses from their proper type is due to reversion, I do not know. Mr.
  Dombrain insists that, whatever may be the commonest kind of imperfection
  in each variety, this is generally exaggerated in the central truss. Thus
  one variety "sometimes has the fault of producing a little green floret
  in the centre of the flower," and in central blooms these become
  excessive in size. In some central blooms, sent to me by Mr. Dombrain,
  all the organs of the flower were rudimentary in structure, of minute
  size, and of a green colour, so that by a little further change all would
  have been converted into small leaves. In this case we clearly see a
  tendency to prolification&mdash;a term which, I may explain to those who
  have never attended to botany, means the production of a branch or
  flower, or head of flowers, out of another flower. Now Dr. Masters<a
  name="NtA_866" href="#Nt_866"><sup>[866]</sup></a> states that the
  central or uppermost flower on a plant is generally the most liable to
  prolification. Thus, in the varieties of the Auricula, the loss of their
  proper character and a tendency to prolification, and in other plants a
  tendency to prolification and pelorism, are all connected together, and
  are due either to arrested development, or to reversion to a former
  condition.</p>

  <p>The following is a more interesting case; Metzger<a name="NtA_867"
  href="#Nt_867"><sup>[867]</sup></a> cultivated in Germany several kinds
  of maize brought from the hotter parts of America, and he found, as has
  been previously described, that in two or three generations the grains
  became greatly changed in form, size, and colour; and with respect to two
  races he expressly states that in the first generation, whilst the lower
  grains on each head retained their proper character, the uppermost grains
  already began to assume that character which in the third generation all
  the grains acquired. As we do not know the aboriginal parent of the
  maize, we cannot tell whether these changes are in any way connected with
  reversion.</p>

  <p>In the two following cases, reversion, as influenced by the position
  of the seed in the capsule, evidently acts. The Blue Imperial pea is the
  offspring of the Blue Prussian, and has larger seed and broader pods than
  its parent. Now Mr. Masters, of Canterbury, a careful observer and a
  raiser of new varieties of the pea, states<a name="NtA_868"
  href="#Nt_868"><sup>[868]</sup></a> that the Blue Imperial always has a
  strong tendency to revert to its parent-stock, and the reversion "occurs
  in this manner: the last (or uppermost) pea in the pod is frequently much
  smaller than the rest; and if these small peas are carefully collected
  and sown separately, very many more, in proportion, will revert to their
  origin, than those taken from the other parts of the pod." Again M.
  Chaté<a name="NtA_869" href="#Nt_869"><sup>[869]</sup></a> says that in
  raising seedling stocks he succeeds in getting eighty per cent. to bear
  double flowers, by leaving only a few of the secondary branches to seed;
  but in addition to this, "at the time of extracting the seeds, the upper
  portion of the pod is separated and <!-- Page 348 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page348"></a>{348}</span>placed aside, because
  it has been ascertained that the plants coming from the seeds situated in
  this portion of the pod, give eighty per cent. of single flowers." Now
  the production of single-flowering plants from the seed of
  double-flowering plants is clearly a case of reversion. These latter
  facts, as well as the connection between a central position and pelorism
  and prolification, show in an interesting manner how small a
  difference&mdash;namely a little greater freedom in the flow of sap
  towards one part of the same plant&mdash;determines important changes of
  structure.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Analogous or Parallel Variation.</i>&mdash;By this term I wish to
  express that similar characters occasionally make their appearance in the
  several varieties or races descended from the same species, and more
  rarely in the offspring of widely distinct species. We are here
  concerned, not as hitherto with the causes of variation, but with the
  results; but this discussion could not have been more conveniently
  introduced elsewhere. The cases of analogous variation, as far as their
  origin is concerned, may be grouped, disregarding minor subdivisions,
  under two main heads; firstly, those due to unknown causes having acted
  on organic beings with nearly the same constitution, and which
  consequently vary in an analogous manner; and secondly, those due to the
  reappearance of characters which were possessed by a more or less remote
  progenitor. But these two main divisions can often be only conjecturally
  separated, and graduate, as we shall presently see, into each other.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Under the first head of analogous variations, not due to reversion, we
  have the many cases of trees belonging to quite different orders which
  have produced pendulous and fastigate varieties. The beech, hazel, and
  barberry have given rise to purple-leaved varieties; and as Bernhardi has
  remarked,<a name="NtA_870" href="#Nt_870"><sup>[870]</sup></a> a
  multitude of plants, as distinct as possible, have yielded varieties with
  deeply-cut or laciniated leaves. Varieties descended from three distinct
  species of Brassica have their stems, or so-called roots, enlarged into
  globular masses. The nectarine is the offspring of the peach; and the
  varieties of both these trees offer a remarkable parallelism in the fruit
  being white, red, or yellow fleshed&mdash;in being clingstones or
  freestones&mdash;in the flowers being large or small&mdash;in the leaves
  being serrated or crenated, furnished with globose or reniform glands, or
  quite destitute of glands. It should be remarked that each variety of the
  nectarine has not derived its character from a corresponding variety of
  the peach. The several varieties also of a closely allied genus, namely
  the apricot, differ from each other in nearly the same parallel manner.
  There is no reason <!-- Page 349 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page349"></a>{349}</span>to believe that in any of these cases
  long-lost characters have reappeared, and in most of them this certainly
  has not occurred.</p>

  <p>Three species of Cucurbita have yielded a multitude of races, which
  correspond so closely in character that, as Naudin insists, they may be
  arranged in an almost strictly parallel series. Several varieties of the
  melon are interesting from resembling in important characters other
  species, either of the same genus or of allied genera; thus, one variety
  has fruit so like, both externally and internally, the fruit of a
  perfectly distinct species, namely, the cucumber, as hardly to be
  distinguished from it; another has long cylindrical fruit twisting about
  like a serpent; in another the seeds adhere to portions of the pulp; in
  another the fruit, when ripe, suddenly cracks and falls into pieces; and
  all these highly remarkable peculiarities are characteristic of species
  belonging to allied genera. We can hardly account for the appearance of
  so many unusual characters by reversion to a single ancient form; but we
  must believe that all the members of the family have inherited a nearly
  similar constitution from an early progenitor. Our cereal and many other
  plants offer similar cases.</p>

  <p>With animals we have fewer cases of analogous variation, independently
  of direct reversion. We see something of the kind in the resemblance
  between the short-muzzled races of the dog, such as the pug and bulldog;
  in feather-footed races of the fowl, pigeon, and canary-bird; in horses
  of the most different races presenting the same range of colour; in all
  black-and-tan dogs having tan-coloured eye-spots and feet, but in this
  latter case reversion may possibly have played a part. Low has remarked<a
  name="NtA_871" href="#Nt_871"><sup>[871]</sup></a> that several breeds of
  cattle are "sheeted,"&mdash;that is, have a broad band of white passing
  round their bodies like a sheet; this character is strongly inherited and
  sometimes originates from a cross; it may be the first step in reversion
  to an original or early type, for, as was shown in the third chapter,
  white cattle with dark ears, feet, and tip of tail formerly existed, and
  now exist in a feral or semi-feral condition in several quarters of the
  world.</p>

  <p>Under our second main division, namely, of analogous variations due to
  reversion, the best cases are afforded by animals, and by none better
  than by pigeons. In all the most distinct breeds sub-varieties
  occasionally appear coloured exactly like the parent rock-pigeon, with
  black wing-bars, white loins, banded tail, &amp;c.; and no one can doubt
  that these characters are simply due to reversion. So with minor details;
  turbits properly have white tails, but occasionally a bird is born with a
  dark-coloured and banded tail; pouters properly have white primary
  wing-feathers, but not rarely a "sword-flighted" bird, that is, one with
  the few first primaries dark-coloured, appears; and in these cases we
  have characters proper to the rock-pigeon, but new to the breed,
  evidently appearing from reversion. In some domestic varieties the
  wing-bars, instead of being simply black, as in the rock-pigeon, are
  beautifully edged with different zones of colour, and they then present a
  striking analogy with the wing-bars in certain natural species of the
  same family, such as <i>Phaps chalcoptera</i>; and this may probably be
  accounted for by <!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page350"></a>{350}</span>all the forms descended from the same
  remote progenitor having a tendency to vary in the same manner. Thus also
  we can perhaps understand the fact of some Laugher-pigeons cooing almost
  like turtle-doves, and of several races having peculiarities in their
  flight, for certain natural species (viz. <i>C. torquatrix</i> and
  <i>palumbus</i>) display singular vagaries in this respect. In other
  cases a race, instead of imitating in character a distinct species,
  resembles some other race; thus certain runts tremble and slightly
  elevate their tails, like fantails; and turbits inflate the upper part of
  their &oelig;sophagus, like pouter-pigeons.</p>

  <p>It is a common circumstance to find certain coloured marks
  persistently characterising all the species of a genus, but differing
  much in tint; and the same thing occurs with the varieties of the pigeon:
  thus, instead of the general plumage being blue with the wing-bars black,
  there are snow-white varieties with red bars, and black varieties with
  white bars; in other varieties the wing-bars, as we have seen, are
  elegantly zoned with different tints. The Spot pigeon is characterised by
  the whole plumage being white, excepting the tail and a spot on the
  forehead; but these parts may be red, yellow, or black. In the
  rock-pigeon and in many varieties the tail is blue, with the outer edges
  of the outer feathers white; but in one sub-variety of the monk-pigeon we
  have a reversed variation, for the tail is white, except the outer edges
  of the outer feathers, which are black.<a name="NtA_872"
  href="#Nt_872"><sup>[872]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With some species of birds, for instance with gulls, certain coloured
  parts appear as if almost washed out, and I have observed exactly the
  same appearance in the terminal dark tail-bar in certain pigeons, and in
  the whole plumage of certain varieties of the duck. Analogous facts in
  the vegetable kingdom could be given.</p>

  <p>Many sub-varieties of the pigeon have reversed and somewhat lengthened
  feathers on the back part of their heads, and this is certainly not due
  to reversion to the parent-species, which shows no trace of such
  structure; but when we remember that sub-varieties of the fowl, turkey,
  canary-bird, duck, and goose, all have topknots or reversed feathers on
  their heads; and when we remember that scarcely a single large natural
  group of birds can be named, in which some members have not a tuft of
  feathers on their heads, we may suspect that reversion to some extremely
  remote form has come into action.</p>

  <p>Several breeds of the fowl have either spangled or pencilled feathers;
  and these cannot be derived from the parent-species, the <i>Gallus
  bankiva</i>; though of course it is possible that an early progenitor of
  this species may have been spangled, and a still earlier or a later
  progenitor may have been pencilled. But as many gallinaceous birds are
  spangled or pencilled, it is a more probable view that the several
  domestic breeds of the fowl have acquired this kind of plumage from all
  the members of the family inheriting a tendency to vary in a like manner.
  The same principle may account for the ewes in certain breeds of sheep
  being hornless, like the females of some other hollow-horned ruminants;
  it may account for certain domestic cats having slightly-tufted ears,
  like those of the lynx; and for the skulls of domestic rabbits often
  differing from each <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page351"></a>{351}</span>other in the same characters by which the
  skulls of the various species of the genus Lepus differ.</p>

  <p>I will only allude to one other case, already discussed. Now that we
  know that the wild parent of the ass has striped legs, we may feel
  confident that the occasional appearance of stripes on the legs of the
  domestic ass is due to direct reversion; but this will not account for
  the lower end of the shoulder-stripe being sometimes angularly bent or
  slightly forked. So, again, when we see dun and other coloured horses
  with stripes on the spine, shoulders, and legs, we are led, from reasons
  formerly given, to believe that they reappear from direct reversion to
  the wild parent-horse. But when horses have two or three shoulder-stripes
  with one of them occasionally forked at the lower end, or when they have
  stripes on their faces, or as foals are faintly striped over nearly their
  whole bodies, with the stripes angularly bent one under the other on the
  forehead, or irregularly branched in other parts, it would be rash to
  attribute such diversified characters to the reappearance of those proper
  to the aboriginal wild horse. As three African species of the genus are
  much striped, and as we have seen that the crossing of the unstriped
  species often leads to the hybrid offspring being conspicuously
  striped&mdash;bearing also in mind that the act of crossing certainly
  causes the reappearance of long-lost characters&mdash;it is a more
  probable view that the above-specified stripes are due to reversion, not
  to the immediate wild parent-horse, but to the striped progenitor of the
  whole genus.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have discussed this subject of analogous variation at considerable
  length, because, in a future work on natural species, it will be shown
  that the varieties of one species frequently mock distinct
  species&mdash;a fact in perfect harmony with the foregoing cases, and
  explicable only on the theory of descent. Secondly, because these facts
  are important from showing, as remarked in a former chapter, that each
  trifling variation is governed by law, and is determined in a much higher
  degree by the nature of the organisation, than by the nature of the
  conditions to which the varying being has been exposed. Thirdly, because
  these facts are to a certain extent related to a more general law,
  namely, that which Mr. B.&nbsp;D. Walsh<a name="NtA_873"
  href="#Nt_873"><sup>[873]</sup></a> has called the "Law of <i>Equable
  Variability</i>," or, as he explains it, "if any given character is very
  variable in one species of a group, it will tend to be variable in allied
  species; and if any given character is perfectly constant in one species
  of a group, it will tend to be constant in allied species."</p>

  <p>This leads me to recall a discussion in the chapter on Selection, in
  which it was shown that with domestic races, which are <!-- Page 352
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page352"></a>{352}</span>now undergoing
  rapid improvement, those parts or characters which are the most valued
  vary the most. This naturally follows from recently selected characters
  continually tending to revert to their former less improved standard, and
  from their being still acted on by the same agencies, whatever these may
  be, which first caused the characters in question to vary. The same
  principle is applicable to natural species, for, as stated in my 'Origin
  of Species,' generic characters are less variable than specific
  characters; and the latter are those which have been modified by
  variation and natural selection, since the period when all the species
  belonging to the same genus branched off from a common progenitor, whilst
  generic characters are those which have remained unaltered from a much
  more remote epoch, and accordingly are now less variable. This statement
  makes a near approach to Mr. Walsh's law of Equable Variability.
  Secondary sexual characters, it may be added, rarely serve to
  characterise distinct genera, for they usually differ much in the species
  of the same genus, and are highly variable in the individuals of the same
  species; we have also seen in the earlier chapters of this work how
  variable secondary sexual characters become under domestication.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Summary of the three previous Chapters, on the Laws of Variation.</i></p>

  <p>In the twenty-third chapter we have seen that changed conditions
  occasionally act in a definite manner on the organisation, so that all,
  or nearly all, the individuals thus exposed become modified in the same
  manner. But a far more frequent result of changed conditions, whether
  acting directly on the organisation or indirectly through the
  reproductive system being affected is indefinite and fluctuating
  variability. In the three latter chapters we have endeavoured to trace
  some of the laws by which such variability is regulated.</p>

  <p>Increased use adds the size of a muscle, together with the
  blood-vessels, nerves, ligaments, the crests of bone to which these are
  attached, the whole bone and other connected bones. So it is with various
  glands. Increased functional activity strengthens the sense-organs.
  Increased and intermittent pressure thickens the epidermis; and a change
  in the nature of the food sometimes modifies the coats of the stomach,
  and increases or <!-- Page 353 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page353"></a>{353}</span>decreases the length of the intestines.
  Continued disuse, on the other hand, weakens and diminishes all parts of
  the organisation. Animals which during many generations have taken but
  little exercise, have their lungs reduced in size, and as a consequence
  the bony fabric of the chest, and the whole form of the body, become
  modified. With our anciently domesticated birds, the wings have been
  little used, and they are slightly reduced; with their decrease, the
  crest of the sternum, the scapulæ, coracoids, and furcula, have all been
  reduced.</p>

  <p>With domesticated animals, the reduction of a part from disuse is
  never carried so far that a mere rudiment is left, but we have good
  reason to believe that this has often occurred under nature. The cause of
  this difference probably is that with domestic animals not only
  sufficient time has not been granted for so profound a change, but that,
  from not being exposed to a severe struggle for life, the principle of
  the economy of organisation does not come into action. On the contrary,
  we sometimes see that structures which are rudimentary in the
  parent-species become partially redeveloped in their domesticated
  progeny. When rudiments are formed or left under domestication, they are
  the result of a sudden arrest of development, and not of long-continued
  disuse with the absorption of all superfluous parts; nevertheless they
  are of interest, as showing that rudiments are the relics of organs once
  perfectly developed.</p>

  <p>Corporeal, periodical, and mental habits, though the latter have been
  almost passed over in this work, become changed under domestication, and
  the changes are often inherited. Such changed habits in any organic
  being, especially when living a free life, would often lead to the
  augmented or diminished use of various organs, and consequently to their
  modification. From long-continued habit, and more especially from the
  occasional birth of individuals with a slightly different constitution,
  domestic animals and cultivated plants become to a certain extent
  acclimatised, or adapted to a climate different from that proper to the
  parent-species.</p>

  <p>Through the principle of correlated variability, when one part varies
  other parts vary,&mdash;either simultaneously, or one after the other.
  Thus an organ modified during an early embryonic period affects other
  parts subsequently developed. When an <!-- Page 354 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>{354}</span>organ, such as the
  beak, increases or decreases in length, adjoining or correlated parts, as
  the tongue and the orifice of the nostrils, tend to vary in the same
  manner. When the whole body increases or decreases in size, various parts
  become modified; thus with pigeons the ribs increase or decrease in
  number and breadth. Homologous parts, which are identical during their
  early development and are exposed to similar conditions, tend to vary in
  the same or in some connected manner,&mdash;as in the case of the right
  and left sides of the body, of the front and hind limbs, and even of the
  head and limbs. So it is with the organs of sight and hearing; for
  instance, white cats with blue eyes are almost always deaf. There is a
  manifest relation throughout the body between the skin and its various
  appendages of hair, feathers, hoofs, horns, and teeth. In Paraguay,
  horses with curly hair have hoofs like those of a mule; the wool and the
  horns of sheep vary together; hairless dogs are deficient in their teeth;
  men with redundant hair have abnormal teeth, either deficient or in
  excess. Birds with long wing-feathers usually have long tail-feathers.
  When long feathers grow from the outside of the legs and toes of pigeons,
  the two outer toes are connected by membrane; for the whole leg tends to
  assume the structure of the wing. There is a manifest relation between a
  crest of feathers on the head and a marvellous amount of change in the
  skull of various fowls; and in a lesser degree, between the greatly
  elongated, lopping ears of rabbits and the structure of their skulls.
  With plants, the leaves, various parts of the flower, and the fruit,
  often vary together in a correlated manner.</p>

  <p>In some cases we find correlation without being able even to
  conjecture what is the nature of the connexion, as with various
  correlated monstrosities and diseases. This is likewise the case with the
  colour of the adult pigeon, in connexion with the presence of down on the
  young bird. Numerous curious instances have been given of peculiarities
  of constitution, in correlation with colour, as shown by the immunity of
  individuals of some one colour from certain diseases, from the attacks of
  parasites, and from the action of certain vegetable poisons.</p>

  <p>Correlation is an important subject; for with species, and in a lesser
  degree with domestic races, we continually find that <!-- Page 355
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page355"></a>{355}</span>certain parts
  have been greatly modified to serve some useful purpose; but we almost
  invariably find that other parts have likewise been more or less
  modified, without our being able to discover any advantage in the change.
  No doubt great caution is necessary in coming to this conclusion, for it
  is difficult to overrate our ignorance on the use of various parts of the
  organisation; but from what we have now seen, we may believe that many
  modifications are of no direct service, having arisen in correlation with
  other and useful changes.</p>

  <p>Homologous parts during their early development evince an affinity for
  each other,&mdash;that is, they tend to cohere and fuse together much
  more readily than other parts. This tendency to fusion explains a
  multitude of normal structures. Multiple and homologous organs are
  especially liable to vary in number and probably in form. As the supply
  of organised matter is not unlimited, the principle of compensation
  sometimes comes into action; so that, when one part is greatly developed,
  adjoining parts or functions are apt to be reduced; but this principle is
  probably of much less importance than the more general one of the economy
  of growth. Through mere mechanical pressure hard parts occasionally
  affect soft adjoining parts. With plants the position of the flowers on
  the axis, and of the seeds in the capsule, sometimes leads, through a
  freer flow of sap, to changes of structure; but these changes are often
  due to reversion. Modifications, in whatever manner caused, will be to a
  certain extent regulated by that co-ordinating power or <i>nisus
  formativus</i>, which is in fact a remnant of one of the forms of
  reproduction, displayed by many lowly organised beings in their power of
  fissiparous generation and budding. Finally, the effects of the laws,
  which directly or indirectly govern variability, may be largely
  influenced by man's selection, and will so far be determined by natural
  selection that changes advantageous to any race will be favoured and
  disadvantageous changes checked.</p>

  <p>Domestic races descended from the same species, or from two or more
  allied species, are liable to revert to characters derived from their
  common progenitor, and, as they have much in common in their
  constitutions, they are also liable under changed conditions to vary in
  the same manner; from these <!-- Page 356 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page356"></a>{356}</span>two causes analogous varieties often
  arise. When we reflect on the several foregoing laws, imperfectly as we
  understand them, and when we bear in mind how much remains to be
  discovered, we need not be surprised at the extremely intricate manner in
  which our domestic productions have varied, and still go on varying.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the previous chapters large classes of facts, such as those bearing
  on bud-variation, the various forms of inheritance, the causes and laws
  of variation, have been discussed; and it is obvious that these subjects,
  as well as the several modes of reproduction, stand in some sort of
  relation to each other. I have been led, or rather forced, to form a view
  which to a certain extent connects these facts by a tangible method.
  Every one would wish to explain to himself, even in an imperfect manner,
  how it is possible for a character possessed by some remote ancestor
  suddenly to reappear in the offspring; how the effects of increased or
  decreased use of a limb can be transmitted to the child; how the male
  sexual element can act not solely on the ovule, but occasionally on the
  mother-form; how a limb can be reproduced on the exact line of
  amputation, with neither too much nor too little added; how the various
  modes of reproduction are connected, and so forth. I am aware that my
  view is merely a provisional hypothesis or speculation; but until a
  better one be advanced, it may be serviceable by bringing together a
  multitude of facts which are at present left disconnected by any
  efficient cause. As Whewell, the historian of the inductive sciences,
  remarks:&mdash;"Hypotheses may often be of service to science, when they
  involve a certain portion of incompleteness, and even of error." Under
  this point of view I venture to advance the hypothesis of Pangenesis,
  which <!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page358"></a>{358}</span>implies that the whole organisation, in
  the sense of every separate atom or unit, reproduces itself. Hence ovules
  and pollen-grains,&mdash;the fertilised seed or egg, as well as
  buds,&mdash;include and consist of a multitude of germs thrown off from
  each separate atom of the organism.</p>

  <p>In the First Part I will enumerate as briefly as I can the groups of
  facts which seem to demand connection; but certain subjects, not hitherto
  discussed, must be treated at disproportionate length. In the Second Part
  the hypothesis will be given; and we shall see, after considering how far
  the necessary assumptions are in themselves improbable, whether it serves
  to bring under a single point of view the various facts.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Part I.</span></p>

  <p>Reproduction may be divided into two main classes, namely, sexual and
  asexual. The latter is effected in many ways&mdash;by gemmation, that is
  by the formation of buds of various kinds, and by fissiparous generation,
  that is by spontaneous or artificial division. It is notorious that some
  of the lower animals, when cut into many pieces, reproduce so many
  perfect individuals: Lyonnet cut a Nais or freshwater worm into nearly
  forty pieces, and these all reproduced perfect animals.<a name="NtA_874"
  href="#Nt_874"><sup>[874]</sup></a> It is probable that segmentation
  could be carried much further in some of the protozoa, and with some of
  the lowest plants each cell will reproduce the parent-form. Johannes
  Müller thought that there was an important distinction between gemmation
  and fission; for in the latter case the divided portion, however small,
  is more perfectly organised; but most physiologists are now convinced
  that the two processes are essentially alike.<a name="NtA_875"
  href="#Nt_875"><sup>[875]</sup></a> Prof. Huxley remarks, "fission is
  little more than a peculiar <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page359"></a>{359}</span>mode of budding," and Prof. H.&nbsp;J. Clark,
  who has especially attended to this subject, shows in detail that there
  is sometimes "a compromise between self-division and budding." When a
  limb is amputated, or when the whole body is bisected, the cut
  extremities are said to bud forth; and as the papilla, which is first
  formed, consists of undeveloped cellular tissue like that forming an
  ordinary bud, the expression is apparently correct. We see the connection
  of the two processes in another way; for Trembley observed that with the
  hydra the reproduction of the head after amputation was checked as soon
  as the animal began to bud.<a name="NtA_876"
  href="#Nt_876"><sup>[876]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Between the production, by fissiparous generation, of two or more
  complete individuals, and the repair of even a very slight injury, we
  have, as remarked in a former chapter, so perfect and insensible a
  gradation, that it is impossible to doubt that they are connected
  processes. Between the power which repairs a trifling injury in any part,
  and the power which previously "was occupied in its maintenance by the
  continued mutation of its particles," there cannot be any great
  difference; and we may follow Mr. Paget in believing them to be the
  selfsame power. As at each stage of growth an amputated part is replaced
  by one in the same state of development, we must likewise follow Mr.
  Paget in admitting "that the powers of development from the embryo are
  identical with those exercised for the restoration from injuries: in
  other words, that the powers are the same by which perfection is first
  achieved, and by which, when lost, it is recovered."<a name="NtA_877"
  href="#Nt_877"><sup>[877]</sup></a> Finally, we may conclude that the
  several forms of gemmation, and of fissiparous generation, the repair of
  injuries, the maintenance of each part in its proper state, and the
  growth or progressive development of the whole structure of the embryo,
  are all essentially the results of one and the same great power.</p>

  <p><i>Sexual Generation.</i>&mdash;The union of the two sexual elements
  seems to make a broad distinction between sexual and asexual
  reproduction. But the well-ascertained cases of Parthenogenesis prove
  that the distinction is not really so great as it at first appears; for
  ovules occasionally, and even in some cases <!-- Page 360 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page360"></a>{360}</span>frequently, become
  developed into perfect beings, without the concourse of the male element.
  J. Müller and others admit that ovules and buds have the same essential
  nature. Certain bodies, which during their early development cannot be
  distinguished by any external character from true ovules, nevertheless
  must be classed as buds, for though formed within the ovarium they are
  incapable of fertilisation. This is the case with the germ-balls of the
  Cecidomyide larvæ, as described by Leuckart.<a name="NtA_878"
  href="#Nt_878"><sup>[878]</sup></a> Ovules and the male element, before
  they become united, have, like buds, an independent existence.<a
  name="NtA_879" href="#Nt_879"><sup>[879]</sup></a> Both have the power of
  transmitting every single character possessed by the parent-form. We see
  this clearly when hybrids are paired <i>inter se</i>, for the characters
  of either grandparent often reappear, either perfectly or by segments, in
  the progeny. It is an error to suppose that the male transmits certain
  characters and the female other characters; though no doubt, from unknown
  causes, one sex sometimes has a stronger power of transmission than the
  other.</p>

  <p>It has been maintained by some authors that a bud differs essentially
  from a fertilised germ, by always reproducing the perfect character of
  the parent-stock; whilst fertilised germs become developed into beings
  which differ, in a greater or less degree, from each other and from their
  parents. But there is no such broad distinction as this. In the eleventh
  chapter, numerous cases were given showing that buds occasionally grow
  into plants having new and strongly marked characters; and varieties thus
  produced can be propagated for a length of time by buds, and occasionally
  by seed. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that beings produced sexually
  are much more liable to vary than those produced asexually; and of this
  fact a partial explanation will hereafter be attempted. The variability
  in both cases is determined by the same general causes, and is governed
  by the same laws. Hence new varieties arising from buds cannot be
  distinguished from those arising from seed. Although bud-varieties
  usually retain their character during <!-- Page 361 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page361"></a>{361}</span>successive
  bud-generations, yet they occasionally revert, even after a long series
  of bud-generations, to their former character. This tendency to reversion
  in buds is one of the most remarkable of the several points of agreement
  between the offspring from bud and seminal reproduction.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one difference between beings produced sexually and
  asexually, which is very general. The former usually pass in the course
  of their development from a lower to a higher grade, as we see in the
  metamorphoses of insects and in the concealed metamorphoses of the
  vertebrata; but this passage from a lower to a higher grade cannot be
  considered as a necessary accompaniment of sexual reproduction, for
  hardly anything of the kind occurs in the development of Aphis amongst
  insects, or with certain crustaceans, cephalopods, or with any of the
  higher vascular plants. Animals propagated asexually by buds or fission
  are on the other hand never known to undergo a retrogressive
  metamorphosis; that is, they do not first sink to a lower, before passing
  on to their higher and final stage of development. But during the act of
  asexual production or subsequently to it, they often advance in
  organisation, as we see in the many cases of "alternate generation." In
  thus speaking of alternate generation, I follow those naturalists who
  look at the process as essentially one of internal budding or of
  fissiparous generation. Some of the lower plants, however, such as mosses
  and certain algæ, according to Dr. L. Radlkofer,<a name="NtA_880"
  href="#Nt_880"><sup>[880]</sup></a> when propagated asexually, do undergo
  a retrogressive metamorphosis. We can to a certain extent understand, as
  far as the final cause is concerned, why beings propagated by buds should
  so rarely retrogress during development; for with each organism the
  structure acquired at each stage of development must be adapted to its
  peculiar habits. Now, with beings produced by gemmation,&mdash;and this,
  differently from sexual reproduction, may occur at any period of
  growth,&mdash;if there were places for the support of many individuals at
  some one stage of development, the simplest plan would be that they
  should be multiplied by gemmation at that stage, and not that they should
  first retrograde in their development to an earlier or simpler structure,
  which might not be fitted for the surrounding conditions.</p>

<p><!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page362"></a>{362}</span></p>

  <p>From the several foregoing considerations we may conclude that the
  difference between sexual and asexual generation is not nearly so great
  as it at first appears; and we have already seen that there is the
  closest agreement between gemmation, fissiparous generation, the repair
  of injuries, and ordinary growth or development. The capacity of
  fertilisation by the male element seems to be the chief distinction
  between an ovule and a bud; and this capacity is not invariably brought
  into action, as in the cases of parthenogenetic reproduction. We are here
  naturally led to inquire what the final cause can be of the necessity in
  ordinary generation for the concourse of the two sexual elements.</p>

  <p>Seeds and ova are often highly serviceable as the means of
  disseminating plants and animals, and of preserving them during one or
  more seasons in a dormant state; but unimpregnated seeds or ova, and
  detached buds, would be equally serviceable for both purposes. We can,
  however, indicate two important advantages gained by the concourse of the
  two sexes, or rather of two individuals belonging to opposite sexes; for,
  as I have shown in a former chapter, the structure of every organism
  appears to be especially adapted for the concurrence, at least
  occasionally, of two individuals. In nearly the same manner as it is
  admitted by naturalists that hybridism, from inducing sterility, is of
  service in keeping the forms of life distinct and fitted for their proper
  places; so, when species are rendered highly variable by changed
  conditions of life, the free intercrossing of the varying individuals
  will tend to keep each form fitted for its proper place in nature; and
  crossing can be effected only by sexual generation, but whether the end
  thus gained is of sufficient importance to account for the first origin
  of sexual intercourse is very doubtful. Secondly, I have shown, from the
  consideration of a large body of facts, that, as a slight change in the
  conditions of life is beneficial to each creature, so, in an analogous
  manner, is the change effected in the germ by sexual union with a
  distinct individual; and I have been led, from observing the many
  widely-extended provisions throughout nature for this purpose, and from
  the greater vigour of crossed organisms of all kinds, as proved by direct
  experiments, as well as from the evil effects of close interbreeding when
  long <!-- Page 363 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page363"></a>{363}</span>continued, to believe that the advantage
  thus gained is very great. Besides these two important ends, there may,
  of course, be others, as yet unknown to us, gained by the concourse of
  the two sexes.</p>

  <p>Why the germ, which before impregnation undergoes a certain amount of
  development, ceases to progress and perishes, unless it be acted on by
  the male element; and why conversely the male element, which is enabled
  to keep alive for even four or five years within the spermatheca of a
  female insect, likewise perishes, unless it acts on or unites with the
  germ, are questions which cannot be answered with any certainty. It is,
  however, possible that both sexual elements perish, unless brought into
  union, simply from including too little formative matter for independent
  existence and development; for certainly they do not in ordinary cases
  differ in their power of giving character to the embryo. This view of the
  importance of the quantity of formative matter seems probable from the
  following considerations. There is no reason to suspect that the
  spermatozoa or pollen-grains of the same individual animal or plant
  differ from each other; yet Quatrefages has shown in the case of the
  Teredo,<a name="NtA_881" href="#Nt_881"><sup>[881]</sup></a> as did
  formerly Prevost and Dumas with other animals, that more than one
  spermatozoon is requisite to fertilise an ovule. This has likewise been
  clearly proved by Newport,<a name="NtA_882"
  href="#Nt_882"><sup>[882]</sup></a> who adds the important fact,
  established by numerous experiments, that, when a very small number of
  spermatozoa are applied to the ova of Batrachians, they are only
  partially impregnated and the embryo is never fully developed: the first
  step, however, towards development, namely, the partial segmentation of
  the yelk, does occur to a greater or less extent, but is never completed
  up to granulation. The rate of the segmentation is likewise determined by
  the number of the spermatozoa. With respect to plants, nearly the same
  results were obtained by Kölreuter and Gärtner. This last careful
  observer found,<a name="NtA_883" href="#Nt_883"><sup>[883]</sup></a>
  after making successive trials on a Malva with more and more
  pollen-grains, that even thirty grains did not fertilise a single seed;
  but when forty grains were applied to the <!-- Page 364 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page364"></a>{364}</span>stigma, a few seeds of
  small size were formed. The pollen-grains of Mirabilis are
  extraordinarily large, and the ovarium contains only a single ovule; and
  these circumstances led Naudin<a name="NtA_884"
  href="#Nt_884"><sup>[884]</sup></a> to make the following interesting
  experiments: a flower was fertilised by three grains and succeeded
  perfectly; twelve flowers were fertilised by two grains, and seventeen
  flowers by a single grain, and of these one flower alone in each lot
  perfected its seed; and it deserves especial notice that the plants
  produced by these two seeds never attained their proper dimensions, and
  bore flowers of remarkably small size. From these facts we clearly see
  that the quantity of the peculiar formative matter which is contained
  within the spermatozoa and pollen-grains is an all-important element in
  the act of fertilisation, not only in the full development of the seed,
  but in the vigour of the plant produced from such seed. We see something
  of the same kind in certain cases of parthenogenesis, that is, when the
  male element is wholly excluded; for M. Jourdan<a name="NtA_885"
  href="#Nt_885"><sup>[885]</sup></a> found that, out of about 58,000 eggs
  laid by unimpregnated silk-moths, many passed through their early
  embryonic stages, showing that they were capable of self-development, but
  only twenty-nine out of the whole number produced caterpillars. Therefore
  it is not an improbable view that deficient bulk or quantity in the
  formative matter, contained within the sexual elements, is the main cause
  of their not having the capacity of prolonged separate existence and
  development. The belief that it is the function of the spermatozoa to
  communicate life to the ovule seems a strange one, seeing that the
  unimpregnated ovule is already alive and continues for a considerable
  time alive. We shall hereafter see that it is probable that the sexual
  elements, or possibly only the female element, include certain primordial
  cells, that is, such as have undergone no differentiation, and which are
  not present in an active state in buds.</p>

  <p><i>Graft-hybrids.</i>&mdash;When discussing in the eleventh chapter
  the curious case of the <i>Cytisus adami</i>, facts were given which
  render it to a certain degree probable, in accordance with the belief of
  some distinguished botanists, that, when the tissues of two plants <!--
  Page 365 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page365"></a>{365}</span>belonging to distinct species or varieties
  are intimately united, buds are afterwards occasionally produced which,
  like hybrids, combine the characters of the two united forms. It is
  certain that when trees with variegated leaves are grafted or budded on a
  common stock, the latter sometimes produces buds bearing variegated
  leaves; but this may perhaps be looked at as a case of inoculated
  disease. Should it ever be proved that hybridised buds can be formed by
  the union of two distinct vegetative tissues, the essential identity of
  sexual and asexual reproduction would be shown in the most interesting
  manner; for the power of combining in the offspring the characters of
  both parents, is the most striking of all the functions of sexual
  generation.</p>

  <p><i>Direct Action of the Male Element on the Female.</i>&mdash;In the
  chapter just referred to, I have given abundant proofs that foreign
  pollen occasionally affects the mother-plant in a direct manner. Thus,
  when Gallesio fertilised an orange-flower with pollen from the lemon, the
  fruit bore stripes of perfectly characterised lemon-peel: with peas,
  several observers have seen the colour of the seed-coats and even of the
  pod directly affected by the pollen of a distinct variety; so it has been
  with the fruit of the apple, which consists of the modified calyx and
  upper part of the flower-stalk. These parts in ordinary cases are wholly
  formed by the mother-plant. We here see the male element affecting and
  hybridising not that part which it is properly adapted to affect, namely
  the ovule, but the partially developed tissues of a distinct individual.
  We are thus brought half-way towards a graft-hybrid, in which the
  cellular tissue of one form, instead of its pollen, is believed to
  hybridise the tissues of a distinct form. I formerly assigned reasons for
  rejecting the belief that the mother-plant is affected through the
  intervention of the hybridised embryo; but even if this view were
  admitted, the case would become one of graft-hybridism, for the
  fertilised embryo and the mother-plant must be looked at as distinct
  individuals.</p>

  <p>With animals which do not breed until nearly mature, and of which all
  the parts are then fully developed, it is hardly possible that the male
  element should directly affect the female. But we have the analogous and
  perfectly well-ascertained case of the male element of a distinct form,
  as with the <!-- Page 366 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page366"></a>{366}</span>quagga and Lord Morton's mare, affecting
  the ovarium of the female, so that the ovules and offspring subsequently
  produced by her when impregnated by other males are plainly affected and
  hybridised by the first male.</p>

  <p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;The fertilised germ reaches maturity by a
  vast number of changes: these are either slight and slowly effected, as
  when the child grows into the man, or are great and sudden, as with the
  metamorphoses of most insects. Between these extremes we have, even
  within the same class, every gradation: thus, as Sir J. Lubbock has
  shown,<a name="NtA_886" href="#Nt_886"><sup>[886]</sup></a> there is an
  Ephemerous insect which moults above twenty times, undergoing each time a
  slight but decided change of structure; and these changes, as he further
  remarks, probably reveal to us the normal stages of development which are
  concealed and hurried through, or suppressed, in most other insects. In
  ordinary metamorphoses, the parts and organs appear to become changed
  into the corresponding parts in the next stage of development; but there
  is another form of development, which has been called by Professor Owen
  metagenesis. In this case "the new parts are not moulded upon the inner
  surface of the old ones. The plastic force has changed its course of
  operation. The outer case, and all that gave form and character to the
  precedent individual, perish and are cast off; they are not changed into
  the corresponding parts of the new individual. These are due to a new and
  distinct developmental process," &amp;c.<a name="NtA_887"
  href="#Nt_887"><sup>[887]</sup></a> Metamorphosis, however, graduates so
  insensibly into metagenesis, that the two processes cannot be distinctly
  separated. For instance, in the last change which Cirripedes undergo, the
  alimentary canal and some other organs are moulded on pre-existing parts;
  but the eyes of the old and the young animal are developed in entirely
  different parts of the body; the tips of the mature limbs are formed
  within the larval limbs, and may be said to be metamorphosed from them;
  but their basal portions and the whole thorax are developed in a plane
  actually at right angles to the limbs and thorax of the larva; and this
  <!-- Page 367 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page367"></a>{367}</span>may be called metagenesis. The metagenetic
  process is carried to an extreme degree in the development of some
  Echinoderms, for the animal in the second stage of development is formed
  almost like a bud within the animal of the first stage, the latter being
  then cast off like an old vestment, yet sometimes still maintaining for a
  short period an independent vitality.<a name="NtA_888"
  href="#Nt_888"><sup>[888]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If, instead of a single individual, several were to be thus developed
  metagenetically within a pre-existing form, the process would be called
  one of alternate generation. The young thus developed may either closely
  resemble the encasing parent-form, as with the larvæ of Cecidomyia, or
  may differ to an astonishing degree, as with many parasitic worms and
  with jelly-fishes; but this does not make any essential difference in the
  process, any more than the greatness or abruptness of the change in the
  metamorphoses of insects.</p>

  <p>The whole question of development is of great importance for our
  present subject. When an organ, the eye for instance, is metagenetically
  formed in a part of the body where during the previous stage of
  development no eye existed, we must look at it as a new and independent
  growth. The absolute independence of new and old structures, which
  correspond in structure and function, is still more obvious when several
  individuals are formed within a previous encasing form, as in the cases
  of alternate generation. The same important principle probably comes
  largely into play even in the case of continuous growth, as we shall see
  when we consider the inheritance of modifications at corresponding
  ages.</p>

  <p>We are led to the same conclusion, namely, the independence of parts
  successively developed, by another and quite distinct group of facts. It
  is well known that many animals belonging to the same class, and
  therefore not differing widely from each other, pass through an extremely
  different course of development. Thus certain beetles, not in any way
  remarkably different from others of the same order, undergo what has been
  called a hyper-metamorphosis&mdash;that is, they pass through an early
  stage wholly different from the ordinary grub-like larva. In the same
  sub-order of crabs, namely, the Macroura, as Fritz <!-- Page 368 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>{368}</span>Müller remarks, the
  river cray-fish is hatched under the same form which it ever afterwards
  retains; the young lobster has divided legs, like a Mysis; the Palæmon
  appears under the form of a Zoea, and Peneus under the Nauplius-form; and
  how wonderfully these larval forms differ from each other, is known to
  every naturalist.<a name="NtA_889" href="#Nt_889"><sup>[889]</sup></a>
  Some other crustaceans, as the same author observes, start from the same
  point and arrive at nearly the same end, but in the middle of their
  development are widely different from each other. Still more striking
  cases could be given with respect to the Echinodermata. With the Medusæ
  or jelly-fishes Professor Allman observes, "the classification of the
  Hydroida would be a comparatively simple task if, as has been erroneously
  asserted, generically-identical medusoids always arose from
  generically-identical polypoids; and on the other hand, that
  generically-identical polypoids always gave origin to
  generically-identical medusoids." So, again, Dr. Strethill Wright
  remarks, "in the life-history of the Hydroidæ any phase, planuloid,
  polypoid, or medusoid, may be absent."<a name="NtA_890"
  href="#Nt_890"><sup>[890]</sup></a></p>

  <p>According to the belief now generally accepted by our best
  naturalists, all the members of the same order or class, the Macrourous
  crustaceans for instance, are descended from a common progenitor. During
  their descent they have diverged much in structure, but have retained
  much in common; and this divergence and retention of character has been
  effected, though they have passed and still pass through marvellously
  different metamorphoses. This fact well illustrates how independent each
  structure must be from that which precedes and follows it in the course
  of development.</p>

  <p><i>The Functional Independence of the Elements or Units of the
  Body.</i>&mdash;Physiologists agree that the whole organism consists of a
  multitude of elemental parts, which are to a great extent independent of
  each other. Each organ, says Claude Bernard,<a name="NtA_891"
  href="#Nt_891"><sup>[891]</sup></a> <!-- Page 369 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page369"></a>{369}</span>has its proper life,
  its autonomy; it can develop and reproduce itself independently of the
  adjoining tissues. The great German authority, Virchow,<a name="NtA_892"
  href="#Nt_892"><sup>[892]</sup></a> asserts still more emphatically that
  each system, as the nervous or osseous system, or the blood, consists of
  an "enormous mass of minute centres of action.... Every element has its
  own special action, and even though it derive its stimulus to activity
  from other parts, yet alone effects the actual performance of its
  duties.... Every single epithelial and muscular fibre-cell leads a sort
  of parasitical existence in relation to the rest of the body.... Every
  single bone-corpuscle really possesses conditions of nutrition peculiar
  to itself." Each element, as Mr. Paget remarks, lives its appointed time,
  and then dies, and, after being cast off or absorbed, is replaced.<a
  name="NtA_893" href="#Nt_893"><sup>[893]</sup></a> I presume that no
  physiologist doubts that, for instance, each bone-corpuscle of the finger
  differs from the corresponding corpuscle in the corresponding joint of
  the toe; and there can hardly be a doubt that even those on the
  corresponding sides of the body differ, though almost identical in
  nature. This near approach to identity is curiously shown in many
  diseases in which the same exact points on the right and left sides of
  the body are similarly affected; thus Mr. Paget<a name="NtA_894"
  href="#Nt_894"><sup>[894]</sup></a> gives a drawing of a diseased pelvis,
  in which the bone has grown into a most complicated pattern, but "there
  is not one spot or line on one side which is not represented, as exactly
  as it would be in a mirror, on the other."</p>

  <p>Many facts support this view of the independent life of each minute
  element of the body. Virchow insists that a single bone-corpuscle or a
  single cell in the skin may become diseased. The spur of a cock, after
  being inserted into the eye of an ox, lived for eight years, and acquired
  a weight of 306 grammes, or nearly fourteen ounces.<a name="NtA_895"
  href="#Nt_895"><sup>[895]</sup></a> The tail of a pig has been grafted
  into the middle of its back, and reacquired sensibility. Dr. Ollier<a
  name="NtA_896" href="#Nt_896"><sup>[896]</sup></a> inserted a piece of
  periosteum from the bone of a young dog under the skin of a rabbit, and
  true bone was developed. A multitude of similar facts could be given. The
  <!-- Page 370 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page370"></a>{370}</span>frequent presence of hairs and of
  perfectly developed teeth, even teeth of the second dentition, in ovarian
  tumours,<a name="NtA_897" href="#Nt_897"><sup>[897]</sup></a> are facts
  leading to the same conclusion.</p>

  <p>Whether each of the innumerable autonomous elements of the body is a
  cell or the modified product of a cell, is a more doubtful question, even
  if so wide a definition be given to the term, as to include cell-like
  bodies without walls and without nuclei.<a name="NtA_898"
  href="#Nt_898"><sup>[898]</sup></a> Professor Lionel Beale uses the term
  "germinal matter" for the contents of cells, taken in this wide
  acceptation, and he draws a broad distinction between germinal matter and
  "formed material" or the various products of cells.<a name="NtA_899"
  href="#Nt_899"><sup>[899]</sup></a> But the doctrine of <i>omnis cellula
  e cellulâ</i> is admitted for plants, and is a widely prevalent belief
  with respect to animals.<a name="NtA_900"
  href="#Nt_900"><sup>[900]</sup></a> Thus Virchow, the great supporter of
  the cellular theory, whilst allowing that difficulties exist, maintains
  that every atom of tissue is derived from cells, and these from
  pre-existing cells, and these primarily from the egg, which he regards as
  a great cell. That cells, still retaining the same nature, increase by
  self-division or proliferation, is admitted by almost every one. But when
  an organism undergoes a great change of structure during development, the
  cells, which at each stage are supposed to be directly derived from
  previously-existing cells, must likewise be greatly changed in nature;
  this change is apparently attributed by the supporters of the cellular
  doctrine to some inherent power which the cells possess, and not to any
  external agency.</p>

  <p>Another school maintains that cells and tissues of all kinds may be
  formed, independently of pre-existing cells, from plastic lymph or
  blastema; and this it is thought is well exhibited in the repair of
  wounds. As I have not especially attended to histology, it would be
  presumptuous in me to express an opinion on the two opposed doctrines.
  But every one appears to admit that the body consists of a multitude of
  "organic units,"<a name="NtA_901" href="#Nt_901"><sup>[901]</sup></a>
  <!-- Page 371 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page371"></a>{371}</span>each of which possesses its own proper
  attributes, and is to a certain extent independent of all others. Hence
  it will be convenient to use indifferently the terms cells or organic
  units or simply units.</p>

  <p><i>Variability and Inheritance.</i>&mdash;We have seen in the
  twenty-second chapter that variability is not a principle co-ordinate
  with life or reproduction, but results from special causes, generally
  from changed conditions acting during successive generations. Part of the
  fluctuating variability thus induced is apparently due to the sexual
  system being easily affected by changed conditions, so that it is often
  rendered impotent; and when not so seriously affected, it often fails in
  its proper function of transmitting truly the characters of the parents
  to the offspring. But variability is not necessarily connected with the
  sexual system, as we see from the cases of bud-variation; and although we
  may not be able to trace the nature of the connexion, it is probable that
  many deviations of structure which appear in sexual offspring result from
  changed conditions acting directly on the organisation, independently of
  the reproductive organs. In some instances we may feel sure of this, when
  all, or nearly all the individuals which have been similarly exposed are
  similarly and definitely affected&mdash;as in the dwarfed and otherwise
  changed maize brought from hot countries when cultivated in Germany; in
  the change of the fleece in sheep within the tropics; to a certain extent
  in the increased size and early maturity of our highly-improved
  domesticated animals; in inherited gout from intemperance; and in many
  other such cases. Now, as such changed conditions do not especially
  affect the reproductive organs, it seems mysterious on any ordinary view
  why their product, the new organic being, should be similarly
  affected.</p>

  <p>How, again, can we explain to ourselves the inherited effects of the
  use or disuse of particular organs? The domesticated duck flies less and
  walks more than the wild duck, and its limb-bones have become in a
  corresponding manner diminished and increased in comparison with those of
  the wild duck. A horse is trained to certain paces, and the colt inherits
  similar consensual movements. The domesticated rabbit becomes tame from
  close confinement; the dog intelligent from associating with man; the
  retriever is taught to fetch and carry: and these <!-- Page 372 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page372"></a>{372}</span>mental endowments and
  bodily powers are all inherited. Nothing in the whole circuit of
  physiology is more wonderful. How can the use or disuse of a particular
  limb or of the brain affect a small aggregate of reproductive cells,
  seated in a distant part of the body, in such a manner that the being
  developed from these cells inherits the characters of either one or both
  parents? Even an imperfect answer to this question would be
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p>Sexual reproduction does not essentially differ, as we have seen, from
  budding or self-division, and these processes graduate through the repair
  of injuries into ordinary development and growth; it might therefore be
  expected that every character would be as regularly transmitted by all
  the methods of reproduction as by continued growth. In the chapters
  devoted to inheritance it was shown that a multitude of newly-acquired
  characters, whether injurious or beneficial, whether of the lowest or
  highest vital importance, are often faithfully
  transmitted&mdash;frequently even when one parent alone possesses some
  new peculiarity. It deserves especial attention that characters appearing
  at any age tend to reappear at a corresponding age. We may on the whole
  conclude that in all cases inheritance is the rule, and non-inheritance
  the anomaly. In some instances a character is not inherited, from the
  conditions of life being directly opposed to its development; in many
  instances, from the conditions incessantly inducing fresh variability, as
  with grafted fruit-trees and highly cultivated flowers. In the remaining
  cases the failure may be attributed to reversion, by which the child
  resembles its grandparents or more remote progenitors, instead of its
  parents.</p>

  <p>This principle of Reversion is the most wonderful of all the
  attributes of Inheritance. It proves to us that the transmission of a
  character and its development, which ordinarily go together and thus
  escape discrimination, are distinct powers; and these powers in some
  cases are even antagonistic, for each acts alternately in successive
  generations. Reversion is not a rare event, depending on some unusual or
  favourable combination of circumstances, but occurs so regularly with
  crossed animals and plants, and so frequently with uncrossed breeds, that
  it is evidently an essential part of the principle of inheritance. We
  know that <!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page373"></a>{373}</span>changed conditions have the power of
  evoking long-lost characters, as in the case of some feral animals. The
  act of crossing in itself possesses this power in a high degree. What can
  be more wonderful than that characters, which have disappeared during
  scores, or hundreds, or even thousands of generations, should suddenly
  reappear perfectly developed, as in the case of pigeons and fowls when
  purely bred, and especially when crossed; or as with the zebrine stripes
  on dun-coloured horses, and other such cases? Many monstrosities come
  under this same head, as when rudimentary organs are redeveloped, or when
  an organ which we must believe was possessed by an early progenitor, but
  of which not even a rudiment is left, suddenly reappears, as with the
  fifth stamen in some Scrophulariaceæ. We have already seen that reversion
  acts in bud-reproduction; and we know that it occasionally acts during
  the growth of the same individual animal, especially, but not
  exclusively, when of crossed parentage,&mdash;as in the rare cases
  described of individual fowls, pigeons, cattle, and rabbits, which have
  reverted as they advanced in years to the colours of one of their parents
  or ancestors.</p>

  <p>We are led to believe, as formerly explained, that every character
  which occasionally reappears is present in a latent form in each
  generation, in nearly the same manner as in male and female animals
  secondary characters of the opposite sex lie latent, ready to be evolved
  when the reproductive organs are injured. This comparison of the
  secondary sexual characters which are latent in both sexes, with other
  latent characters, is the more appropriate from the case recorded of the
  Hen, which assumed some of the masculine characters, not of her own race,
  but of an early progenitor; she thus exhibited at the same time the
  redevelopment of latent characters of both kinds and connected both
  classes. In every living creature we may feel assured that a host of lost
  characters lie ready to be evolved under proper conditions. How can we
  make intelligible, and connect with other facts, this wonderful and
  common capacity of reversion,&mdash;this power of calling back to life
  long-lost characters? <!-- Page 374 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page374"></a>{374}</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Part II.</span></p>

  <p>I have now enumerated the chief facts which every one would desire to
  connect by some intelligible bond. This can be done, as it seems to me,
  if we make the following assumptions; if the first and chief one be not
  rejected, the others, from being supported by various physiological
  considerations, will not appear very improbable. It is almost universally
  admitted that cells, or the units of the body, propagate themselves by
  self-division or proliferation, retaining the same nature, and ultimately
  becoming converted into the various tissues and substances of the body.
  But besides this means of increase I assume that cells, before their
  conversion into completely passive or "formed material," throw off minute
  granules or atoms, which circulate freely throughout the system, and when
  supplied with proper nutriment multiply by self-division, subsequently
  becoming developed into cells like those from which they were derived.
  These granules for the sake of distinctness may be called cell-gemmules,
  or, as the cellular theory is not fully established, simply gemmules.
  They are supposed to be transmitted from the parents to the offspring,
  and are generally developed in the generation which immediately succeeds,
  but are often transmitted in a dormant state during many generations and
  are then developed. Their development is supposed to depend on their
  union with other partially developed cells or gemmules which precede them
  in the regular course of growth. Why I use the term union, will be seen
  when we discuss the direct action of pollen on the tissues of the
  mother-plant. Gemmules are supposed to be thrown off by every cell or
  unit, not only during the adult state, but during all the stages of
  development. Lastly, I assume that the gemmules in their dormant state
  have a mutual affinity for each other, leading to their aggregation
  either into buds or into the sexual elements. Hence, speaking strictly,
  it is not the reproductive elements, nor the buds, which generate new
  organisms, but the cells themselves throughout the body. These
  assumptions constitute the provisional hypothesis which I have called
  Pangenesis. Nearly <!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page375"></a>{375}</span>similar views have been propounded, as I
  find, by other authors, more especially by Mr. Herbert Spencer;<a
  name="NtA_902" href="#Nt_902"><sup>[902]</sup></a> but they are here
  modified and amplified.</p>

<p><!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page376"></a>{376}</span></p>

  <p>Before proceeding to show, firstly, how far these assumptions are in
  themselves probable, and secondly, how far they connect and explain the
  various groups of facts with which we are concerned, it may be useful to
  give an illustration of the hypothesis. If one of the simplest Protozoa
  be formed, as appears under the microscope, of a small mass of
  homogeneous gelatinous matter, a minute atom thrown off from any part and
  nourished under favourable circumstances would naturally reproduce the
  whole; but if the upper and lower surfaces were to differ in texture from
  the central portion, then all three parts would have to throw off atoms
  or gemmules, which when aggregated by mutual affinity would form either
  buds or the sexual elements. Precisely the same view may be extended to
  one of the higher animals; although in this case many thousand gemmules
  must be thrown off from the various parts of the body. Now, when the leg,
  for instance, of a salamander is cut off, a slight crust forms over the
  wound, and beneath this crust the uninjured cells or units of bone,
  muscle, nerves, &amp;c., are supposed to unite with the diffused gemmules
  of those cells which in the perfect leg come next in order; and these as
  they become slightly developed unite with others, and so on until a
  papilla of soft cellular tissue, the "budding leg," is formed, and in
  time a perfect leg.<a name="NtA_903" href="#Nt_903"><sup>[903]</sup></a>
  Thus, that portion of the leg which had <!-- Page 377 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page377"></a>{377}</span>been cut off, neither
  more nor less, would be reproduced. If the tail or leg of a young animal
  had been cut off, a young tail or leg would have been reproduced, as
  actually occurs with the amputated tail of the tadpole; for gemmules of
  all the units which compose the tail are diffused throughout the body at
  all ages. But during the adult state the gemmules of the larval tail
  would remain dormant, for they would not meet with pre-existing cells in
  a proper state of development with which to unite. If from changed
  conditions or any other cause any part of the body should become
  permanently modified, the gemmules, which are merely minute portions of
  the contents of the cells forming the part, would naturally reproduce the
  same modification. But gemmules previously derived from the same part
  before it had undergone any change, would still be diffused throughout
  the organisation, and would be transmitted from generation to generation,
  so that under favourable circumstances they might be redeveloped, and
  then the new modification would be for a time or for ever lost. The
  aggregation of gemmules derived from every part of the body, through
  their mutual affinity, would form buds, and their aggregation in some
  special manner, apparently in small quantity, together probably with the
  presence of gemmules of certain primordial cells, would constitute the
  sexual elements. By means of these illustrations the hypothesis of
  pangenesis has, I hope, been rendered intelligible.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Physiologists maintain, as we have seen, that each cell, though to a
  large extent dependent on others, is likewise, to a certain extent,
  independent or autonomous. I go one small step further, and assume that
  each cell casts off a free gemmule, which is capable of reproducing a
  similar cell. There is some analogy between this view and what we see in
  compound animals and in the flower-buds on the same tree; for these are
  distinct individuals capable of true or seminal reproduction, yet have
  parts in common and are dependent on each other; thus <!-- Page 378
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page378"></a>{378}</span>the tree has
  its bark and trunk, and certain corals, as the Virgularia, have not only
  parts, but movements in common.</p>

  <p>The existence of free gemmules is a gratuitous assumption, yet can
  hardly be considered as very improbable, seeing that cells have the power
  of multiplication through the self-division of their contents. Gemmules
  differ from true ovules or buds inasmuch as they are supposed to be
  capable of multiplication in their undeveloped state. No one probably
  will object to this capacity as improbable. The blastema within the egg
  has been known to divide and give birth to two embryos; and Thuret<a
  name="NtA_904" href="#Nt_904"><sup>[904]</sup></a> has seen the zoospore
  of an alga divide itself, and both halves germinate. An atom of small-pox
  matter, so minute as to be borne by the wind, must multiply itself many
  thousand-fold in a person thus inoculated.<a name="NtA_905"
  href="#Nt_905"><sup>[905]</sup></a> It has recently been ascertained<a
  name="NtA_906" href="#Nt_906"><sup>[906]</sup></a> that a minute portion
  of the mucous discharge from an animal affected with rinderpest, if
  placed in the blood of a healthy ox, increases so fast that in a short
  space of time "the whole mass of blood, weighing many pounds, is
  infected, and every small particle of that blood contains enough poison
  to give, within less than forty-eight hours, the disease to another
  animal."</p>

  <p>The retention of free and undeveloped gemmules in the same body from
  early youth to old age may appear improbable, but we should remember how
  long seeds lie dormant in the earth and buds in the bark of a tree. Their
  transmission from generation to generation may appear still more
  improbable; but here again we should remember that many rudimentary and
  useless organs are transmitted and have been transmitted during an
  indefinite number of generations. We shall presently see how well the
  long-continued transmission of undeveloped gemmules explains many
  facts.</p>

  <p>As each unit, or group of similar units throughout the body, casts off
  its gemmules, and as all are contained within the smallest egg or seed,
  and within each spermatozoon or pollen-grain, their number and minuteness
  must be something <!-- Page 379 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page379"></a>{379}</span>inconceivable. I shall hereafter recur to
  this objection, which at first appears so formidable; but it may here be
  remarked that a cod-fish has been found to produce 4,872,000 eggs, a
  single Ascaris about 64,000,000 eggs, and a single Orchidaceous plant
  probably as many million seeds.<a name="NtA_907"
  href="#Nt_907"><sup>[907]</sup></a> In these several cases, the
  spermatozoa and pollen-grains must exist in considerably larger numbers.
  Now, when we have to deal with numbers such as these, which the human
  intellect cannot grasp, there is no good reason for rejecting our present
  hypothesis on account of the assumed existence of cell-gemmules a few
  thousand times more numerous.</p>

  <p>The gemmules in each organism must be thoroughly diffused; nor does
  this seem improbable considering their minuteness, and the steady
  circulation of fluids throughout the body. So it must be with the
  gemmules of plants, for with certain kinds even a minute fragment of a
  leaf will reproduce the whole. But a difficulty here occurs; it would
  appear that with plants, and probably with compound animals, such as
  corals, the gemmules do not spread from bud to bud, but only through the
  tissues developed from each separate bud. We are led to this conclusion
  from the stock being rarely affected by the insertion of a bud or graft
  from a distinct variety. This non-diffusion of the gemmules is still more
  plainly shown in the case of ferns; for Mr. Bridgman<a name="NtA_908"
  href="#Nt_908"><sup>[908]</sup></a> has proved that, when spores (which
  it should be remembered are of the nature of buds) are taken from a
  monstrous part of a frond, and others from an ordinary part, <!-- Page
  380 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page380"></a>{380}</span>each
  reproduces the form of the part whence derived. But this non-diffusion of
  the gemmules from bud to bud may be only apparent, depending, as we shall
  hereafter see, on the nature of the first-formed cells in the buds.</p>

  <p>The assumed elective affinity of each gemmule for that particular cell
  which precedes it in the order of development is supported by many
  analogies. In all ordinary cases of sexual reproduction the male and
  female elements have a mutual affinity for each other: thus, it is
  believed that about ten thousand species of Compositæ exist, and there
  can be no doubt that if the pollen of all these species could be,
  simultaneously or successively, placed on the stigma of any one species,
  this one would elect with unerring certainty its own pollen. This
  elective capacity is all the more wonderful, as it must have been
  acquired since the many species of this great group of plants branched
  off from a common progenitor. On any view of the nature of sexual
  reproduction, the protoplasm contained within the ovules and within the
  sperm-cells (or the "spermatic force" of the latter, if so vague a term
  be preferred) must act on each other by some law of special affinity,
  either during or subsequently to impregnation, so that corresponding
  parts alone affect each other; thus, a calf produced from a short-horned
  cow by a long-horned bull has its horns and not its horny hoofs affected
  by the union of the two forms, and the offspring from two birds with
  differently coloured tails have their tails and not their whole plumage
  affected.</p>

  <p>The various tissues of the body plainly show, as many physiologists
  have insisted,<a name="NtA_909" href="#Nt_909"><sup>[909]</sup></a> an
  affinity for special organic substances, whether natural or foreign to
  the body. We see this in the cells of the kidneys attracting urea from
  the blood; in the worrara poison affecting the nerves; upas and digitalis
  the muscles; the Lytta vesicatoria the kidneys; and in the poisonous
  matter of many diseases, as small-pox, scarlet-fever, hooping-cough,
  glanders, cancer, and hydrophobia, affecting certain definite parts of
  the body or certain tissues or glands.</p>

  <p>The affinity of various parts of the body for each other during <!--
  Page 381 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page381"></a>{381}</span>their
  early development was shown in the last chapter, when discussing the
  tendency to fusion in homologous parts. This affinity displays itself in
  the normal fusion of organs which are separate at an early embryonic age,
  and still more plainly in those marvellous cases of double monsters in
  which each bone, muscle, vessel, and nerve in the one embryo, blends with
  the corresponding part in the other. The affinity between homologous
  organs may come into action with single parts, or with the entire
  individual, as in the case of flowers or fruits which are symmetrically
  blended together with all their parts doubled, but without any other
  trace of fusion.</p>

  <p>It has also been assumed that the development of each gemmule depends
  on its union with another cell or unit which has just commenced its
  development, and which, from preceding it in order of growth, is of a
  somewhat different nature. Nor is it a very improbable assumption that
  the development of a gemmule is determined by its union with a cell
  slightly different in nature, for abundant evidence was given in the
  seventeenth chapter, showing that a slight degree of differentiation in
  the male and female sexual elements favours in a marked manner their
  union and subsequent development. But what determines the development of
  the gemmules of the first-formed or primordial cell in the unimpregnated
  ovule, is beyond conjecture.</p>

  <p>It must also be admitted that analogy fails to guide us towards any
  determination on several other points: for instance, whether cells,
  derived from the same parent-cell, may, in the regular course of growth,
  become developed into different structures, from absorbing peculiar kinds
  of nutriment, independently of their union with distinct gemmules. We
  shall appreciate this difficulty if we call to mind, what complex yet
  symmetrical growths the cells of plants yield when they are inoculated by
  the poison of a gall-insect. With animals various polypoid excrescences
  and tumours are now generally admitted<a name="NtA_910"
  href="#Nt_910"><sup>[910]</sup></a> to be the direct product, through
  proliferation, of normal cells which have become abnormal. In the regular
  growth and repair of bones, the tissues undergo, as Virchow remarks,<a
  name="NtA_911" href="#Nt_911"><sup>[911]</sup></a> a whole series of
  permutations and substitutions. "The cartilage-cells may be <!-- Page 382
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"></a>{382}</span>converted by a
  direct transformation into marrow-cells, and continue as such; or they
  may first be converted into osseous and then into medullary tissue; or
  lastly, they may first be converted into marrow and then into bone. So
  variable are the permutations of these tissues, in themselves so nearly
  allied, and yet in their external appearance so completely distinct." But
  as these tissues thus change their nature at any age, without any obvious
  change in their nutrition, we must suppose in accordance with our
  hypothesis that gemmules derived from one kind of tissue combine with the
  cells of another kind, and cause the successive modifications.</p>

  <p>It is useless to speculate at what period of development each organic
  unit casts off its gemmules; for the whole subject of the development of
  the various elemental tissues is as yet involved in much doubt. Some
  physiologists, for instance, maintain that muscle or nerve-fibres are
  developed from cells, which are afterwards nourished by their own proper
  powers of absorption; whilst other physiologists deny their cellular
  origin; and Beale maintains that such fibres are renovated exclusively by
  the conversion of fresh germinal matter (that is the so-called nuclei)
  into "formed material." However this may be, it appears probable that all
  external agencies, such as changed nutrition, increased use or disuse,
  &amp;c., which induced any permanent modification in a structure, would
  at the same time or previously act on the cells, nuclei, germinal or
  formative matter, from which the structures in question were developed,
  and consequently would act on the gemmules or cast-off atoms.</p>

  <p>There is another point on which it is useless to speculate, namely,
  whether all gemmules are free and separate, or whether some are from the
  first united into small aggregates. A feather, for instance, is a complex
  structure, and, as each separate part is liable to inherited variations,
  I conclude that each feather certainly generates a large number of
  gemmules; but it is possible that these may be aggregated into a compound
  gemmule. The same remark applies to the petals of a flower, which in some
  cases are highly complex, with each ridge and hollow contrived for
  special purposes, so that each part must have been separately modified,
  and the modifications transmitted; consequently, separate gemmules,
  according to our hypothesis, <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page383"></a>{383}</span>must have been thrown off from each cell
  or part. But, as we sometimes see half an anther or a small portion of a
  filament becoming petaliform, or parts or mere stripes of the calyx
  assuming the colour and texture of the corolla, it is probable that with
  petals the gemmules of each cell are not aggregated together into a
  compound gemmule, but are freely and separately diffused.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Having now endeavoured to show that the several foregoing assumptions
  are to a certain extent supported by analogous facts, and having
  discussed some of the most doubtful points, we will consider how far the
  hypothesis brings under a single point of view the various cases
  enumerated in the First Part. All the forms of reproduction graduate into
  each other and agree in their product; for it is impossible to
  distinguish between organisms produced from buds, from self-division, or
  from fertilised germs; such organisms are liable to variations of the
  same nature and to reversion of character; and as we now see that all the
  forms of reproduction depend on the aggregation of gemmules derived from
  the whole body, we can understand this general agreement. It is
  satisfactory to find that sexual and asexual generation, by both of which
  widely different processes the same living creature is habitually
  produced, are fundamentally the same. Parthenogenesis is no longer
  wonderful; in fact, the wonder is that it should not oftener occur. We
  see that the reproductive organs do not actually create the sexual
  elements; they merely determine or permit the aggregation of the gemmules
  in a special manner. These organs, together with their accessory parts,
  have, however, high functions to perform; they give to both elements a
  special affinity for each other, independently of the contents of the
  male and female cells, as is shown in the case of plants by the mutual
  reaction of the stigma and pollen-grains; they adapt one or both elements
  for independent temporary existence, and for mutual union. The
  contrivances for these purposes are sometimes wonderfully complex, as
  with the spermatophores of the Cephalopoda. The male element sometimes
  possesses attributes which, if observed in an independent animal, would
  be put down to instinct guided by sense-organs, as when the <!-- Page 384
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page384"></a>{384}</span>spermatozoon
  of an insect finds its way into the minute micropyle of the egg, or as
  when the antherozoids of certain algæ swim by the aid of their ciliæ to
  the female plant, and force themselves <span class="correction"
  title="Originally printed on following line, after `must'.">into</span> a
  minute orifice. In these latter cases, however, we must believe that the
  male element has acquired its powers, on the same principle with the
  larvæ of animals, namely by successive modifications developed at
  corresponding periods of life: we can hardly avoid in these cases looking
  at the male element as a sort of premature larva, which unites, or, like
  one of the lower algæ, conjugates, with the female element. What
  determines the aggregation of the gemmules within the sexual organs we do
  not in the least know; nor do we know why buds are formed in certain
  definite places, leading to the symmetrical growth of trees and corals,
  nor why adventitious buds may be formed almost anywhere, even on a petal,
  and frequently upon healed wounds.<a name="NtA_912"
  href="#Nt_912"><sup>[912]</sup></a> As soon as the gemmules have
  aggregated themselves, development apparently commences, but in the case
  of buds is often afterwards suspended, and in the case of the sexual
  elements soon ceases, unless the elements of the opposite sexes combine;
  even after this has occurred, the fertilised germ, as with seeds buried
  in the ground, may remain during a lengthened period in a dormant
  state.</p>

  <p>The antagonism which has long been observed,<a name="NtA_913"
  href="#Nt_913"><sup>[913]</sup></a> though exceptions occur,<a
  name="NtA_914" href="#Nt_914"><sup>[914]</sup></a> between active growth
  and the power of sexual reproduction&mdash;between the repair of injuries
  and gemmation&mdash;and with plants, between rapid increase by buds,
  rhizomes, &amp;c., and the production of seed, is partly explained by the
  gemmules not existing in sufficient numbers for both processes. <!-- Page
  385 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page385"></a>{385}</span>But this
  explanation hardly applies to those plants which naturally produce a
  multitude of seeds, but which, through a comparatively small increase in
  the number of the buds on their rhizomes or offsets, yield few or no
  seed. As, however, we shall presently see that buds probably include
  tissue which has already been to a certain extent developed or
  differentiated, some additional organised matter will thus have been
  expended.</p>

  <p>From one of the forms of Reproduction, namely, spontaneous
  self-division, we are led by insensible steps to the repair of the
  slightest injury; and the existence of gemmules, derived from every cell
  or unit throughout the body and everywhere diffused, explains all such
  cases,&mdash;even the wonderful fact that, when the limbs of the
  salamander were cut off many times successively by Spallanzani and
  Bonnet, they were exactly and completely reproduced. I have heard this
  process compared with the recrystallisation which occurs when the angles
  of a broken crystal are repaired; and the two processes have this much in
  common, that in the one case the polarity of the molecules is the
  efficient cause, and in the other the affinity of the gemmules for
  particular nascent cells.</p>

  <p>Pangenesis does not throw much light on Hybridism, but agrees well
  with most of the ascertained facts. We may conclude from the fact of a
  single spermatozoon or pollen-grain being insufficient for impregnation,
  that a certain number of gemmules derived from each cell or unit are
  required for the development of each part. From the occurrence of
  parthenogenesis, more especially in the case of the silk-moth, in which
  the embryo is often partially formed, we may also infer that the female
  element includes nearly sufficient gemmules of all kinds for independent
  development, so that when united with the male element the gemmules must
  be superabundant. Now, as a general rule, when two species or races are
  crossed reciprocally, the offspring do not differ, and this shows that
  both sexual elements agree in power, in accordance with the view that
  they include the same gemmules. Hybrids and mongrels are generally
  intermediate in character between the two parent-forms, yet occasionally
  they closely resemble one parent in one part and the other parent in
  another part, or even in their whole structure: nor is this difficult to
  understand on <!-- Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page386"></a>{386}</span>the admission that the gemmules in the
  fertilised germ are superabundant in number, and that those derived from
  one parent have some advantage in number, affinity, or vigour over those
  derived from the other parent. Crossed forms sometimes exhibit the colour
  or other characters of either parent in stripes or blotches; and this may
  occur in the first generation, or through reversion in succeeding bud and
  seminal generations, as in the several instances given in the eleventh
  chapter. In these cases we must follow Naudin,<a name="NtA_915"
  href="#Nt_915"><sup>[915]</sup></a> and admit that the "essence" or
  "element" of the two species, which terms I should translate into the
  gemmules, have an affinity for their own kind, and thus separate
  themselves into distinct stripes or blotches; and reasons were given,
  when discussing in the fifteenth chapter the incompatibility of certain
  characters to unite, for believing in such mutual affinity. When two
  forms are crossed, one is not rarely found to be prepotent in the
  transmission of character over the other; and this we can explain only by
  again assuming that the one form has some advantage in the number,
  vigour, or affinity of its gemmules, except in those cases, where certain
  characters are present in the one form and latent in the other. For
  instance, there is a latent tendency in all pigeons to become blue, and,
  when a blue pigeon is crossed with one of any other colour, the blue tint
  is generally prepotent. When we consider latent characters, the
  explanation of this form of prepotency will be obvious.</p>

  <p>When one species is crossed with another it is notorious that they do
  not yield the full or proper number of offspring; and we can only say on
  this head that, as the development of each organism depends on such
  nicely-balanced affinities between a host of gemmules and developing
  cells or units, we need not feel at all surprised that the commixture of
  gemmules derived from two distinct species should lead to a partial or
  complete failure of development. With respect to the sterility of hybrids
  produced from the union of two distinct species, it was shown in the
  nineteenth chapter that this depends exclusively on the reproductive
  organs being specially affected; but why these organs should be thus
  affected we do not know, any more than <!-- Page 387 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page387"></a>{387}</span>why unnatural
  conditions of life, though compatible with health, should cause
  sterility; or why continued close interbreeding, or the illegitimate
  unions of dimorphic and trimorphic plants, induce the same result. The
  conclusion that the reproductive organs alone are affected, and not the
  whole organisation, agrees perfectly with the unimpaired or even
  increased capacity in hybrid plants for propagation by buds; for this
  implies, according to our hypothesis, that the cells of the hybrids throw
  off hybridised cell-gemmules, which become aggregated into buds, but fail
  to become aggregated within the reproductive organs, so as to form the
  sexual elements. In a similar manner many plants, when placed under
  unnatural conditions, fail to produce seed, but can readily be propagated
  by buds. We shall presently see that pangenesis agrees well with the
  strong tendency to reversion exhibited by all crossed animals and
  plants.</p>

  <p>It was shown in the discussion on graft-hybrids that there is some
  reason to believe that portions of cellular tissue taken from distinct
  plants become so intimately united, as afterwards occasionally to produce
  crossed or hybridised buds. If this fact were fully established, it
  would, by the aid of our hypothesis, connect gemmation and sexual
  reproduction in the closest manner.</p>

  <p>Abundant evidence has been advanced proving that pollen taken from one
  species or variety and applied to the stigma of another sometimes
  directly affects the tissues of the mother-plant. It is probable that
  this occurs with many plants during fertilisation, but can only be
  detected when distinct forms are crossed. On any ordinary theory of
  reproduction this is a most anomalous circumstance, for the pollen-grains
  are manifestly adapted to act on the ovule, but in these cases they act
  on the colour, texture, and form of the coats of the seeds, on the
  ovarium itself, which is a modified leaf, and even on the calyx and upper
  part of the flower-peduncle. In accordance with the hypothesis of
  pangenesis pollen includes gemmules, derived from every part of the
  organisation, which diffuse themselves and multiply by self-division;
  hence it is not surprising that gemmules within the pollen, which are
  derived from the parts near the reproductive organs, should sometimes be
  able to affect the same parts, whilst still undergoing development, in
  the mother-plant. <!-- Page 388 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page388"></a>{388}</span></p>

  <p>As, during all the stages of development, the tissues of plants
  consist of cells, and as new cells are not known to be formed between, or
  independently of, pre-existing cells, we must conclude that the gemmules
  derived from the foreign pollen do not become developed merely in contact
  with pre-existing cells, but actually penetrate the nascent cells of the
  mother-plant. This process may be compared with the ordinary act of
  fertilisation, during which the contents of the pollen-tubes penetrate
  the closed embryonic sack within the ovule, and determine the development
  of the embryo. According to this view, the cells of the mother-plant may
  almost literally be said to be fertilised by the gemmules derived from
  the foreign pollen. With all organisms, as we shall presently see, the
  cells or organic units of the embryo during the successive stages of
  development may in like manner be said to be fertilised by the gemmules
  of the cells, which come next in the order of formation.</p>

  <p>Animals, when capable of sexual reproduction, are fully developed, and
  it is scarcely possible that the male element should affect the tissues
  of the mother in the same direct manner as with plants; nevertheless it
  is certain that her ovaria are sometimes affected by a previous
  impregnation, so that the ovules subsequently fertilised by a distinct
  male are plainly influenced in character; and this, as in the case of
  foreign pollen, is intelligible through the diffusion, retention, and
  action of the gemmules included within the spermatozoa of the previous
  male.</p>

  <p>Each organism reaches maturity through a longer or shorter course of
  development. The changes may be small and insensibly slow, as when a
  child grows into a man, or many, abrupt, and slight, as in the
  metamorphoses of certain ephemerous insects, or again few and strongly
  marked, as with most other insects. Each part may be moulded within a
  previously existing and corresponding part, and in this case it will
  appear, falsely as I believe, to be formed from the old part; or it may
  be developed within a wholly distinct part of the body, as in the extreme
  cases of metagenesis. An eye, for instance, may be developed at a spot
  where no eye previously existed. We have also seen that allied organic
  beings in the course of their metamorphoses sometimes attain nearly the
  same structure after passing <!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page389"></a>{389}</span>through widely different forms; or
  conversely, after passing through nearly the same early forms, arrive at
  a widely different termination. In these cases it is very difficult to
  believe that the early cells or units possess the inherent power,
  independently of any external agent, of producing new structures wholly
  different in form, position, and function. But these cases become plain
  on the hypothesis of pangenesis. The organic units, during each stage of
  development, throw off gemmules, which, multiplying, are transmitted to
  the offspring. In the offspring, as soon as any particular cell or unit
  in the proper order of development becomes partially developed, it unites
  with (or to speak metaphorically is fertilised by) the gemmule of the
  next succeeding cell, and so onwards. Now, supposing that at any stage of
  development, certain cells or aggregates of cells had been slightly
  modified by the action of some disturbing cause, the cast-off gemmules or
  atoms of the cell-contents could hardly fail to be similarly affected,
  and consequently would reproduce the same modification. This process
  might be repeated until the structure of the part at this particular
  stage of development became greatly changed, but this would not
  necessarily affect other parts whether previously or subsequently
  developed. In this manner we can understand the remarkable independence
  of structure in the successive metamorphoses, and especially in the
  successive metageneses of many animals.</p>

  <p>The term growth ought strictly to be confined to mere increase of
  size, and development to change of structure.<a name="NtA_916"
  href="#Nt_916"><sup>[916]</sup></a> Now, a child is said to grow into a
  man, and a foal into a horse, but, as in these cases there is much change
  of structure, the process properly belongs to the order of development.
  We have indirect evidence of this in many variations and diseases
  supervening during so-called growth at a particular period, and being
  inherited at a corresponding period. In the case, however, of diseases
  which supervene during old age, subsequently to the ordinary period of
  procreation, and which nevertheless are sometimes inherited, as occurs
  with brain and heart complaints, we <!-- Page 390 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page390"></a>{390}</span>must suppose that the
  organs were in fact affected at an earlier age and threw off at this
  period affected gemmules; but that the affection became visible or
  injurious only after the prolonged growth of the part in the strict sense
  of the word. In all the changes of structure which regularly supervene
  during old age, we see the effects of deteriorated growth, and not of
  true development.</p>

  <p>In the so-called process of <i>alternate generation</i> many
  individuals are generated asexually during very early or later stages of
  development. These individuals may closely resemble the preceding larval
  form, but generally are wonderfully dissimilar. To understand this
  process we must suppose that at a certain stage of development the
  gemmules are multiplied at an unusual rate, and become aggregated by
  mutual affinity at many centres of attraction, or buds. These buds, it
  may be remarked, must include gemmules not only of all the succeeding but
  likewise of all the preceding stages of development; for when mature they
  have the power of transmitting by sexual generation gemmules of all the
  stages, however numerous these may be. It was shown in the First Part, at
  least in regard to animals, that the new beings which are thus at any
  period asexually generated do not retrograde in development&mdash;that
  is, they do not pass through those earlier stages, through which the
  fertilised germ of the same animal has to pass; and an explanation of
  this fact was attempted as far as the final or teleological cause is
  concerned. We can likewise understand the proximate cause, if we assume,
  and the assumption is far from improbable, that buds, like chopped-up
  fragments of a hydra, are formed of tissue which has already passed
  through several of the earlier stages of development; for in this case
  their component cells or units would not unite with the gemmules derived
  from the earlier-formed cells, but only with those which came next in the
  order of development. On the other hand, we must believe that, in the
  sexual elements, or probably in the female alone, gemmules of certain
  primordial cells are present; and these, as soon as their development
  commences, unite in due succession with the gemmules of every part of the
  body, from the first to the last period of life.</p>

  <p>The principle of the independent formation of each part, in <!-- Page
  391 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page391"></a>{391}</span>so far as
  its development depends on the union of the proper gemmules with certain
  nascent cells, together with the superabundance of the gemmules derived
  from both parents and self-multiplied, throws light on a widely different
  group of facts, which on any ordinary view of development appears very
  strange. I allude to organs which are abnormally multiplied or
  transposed. Thus gold-fish often have supernumerary fins placed on
  various parts of their bodies. We have seen that, when the tail of a
  lizard is broken off, a double tail is sometimes reproduced, and when the
  foot of the salamander is divided longitudinally, additional digits are
  occasionally formed. When frogs, toads, &amp;c., are born with their
  limbs doubled, as sometimes occurs, the doubling, as Gervais remarks,<a
  name="NtA_917" href="#Nt_917"><sup>[917]</sup></a> cannot be due to the
  complete fusion of two embryos, with the exception of the limbs, for the
  larvæ are limbless. The same argument is applicable<a name="NtA_918"
  href="#Nt_918"><sup>[918]</sup></a> to certain insects produced with
  multiple legs or antennæ, for these are metamorphosed from apodal or
  antennæless larvæ. Alphonse Milne-Edwards<a name="NtA_919"
  href="#Nt_919"><sup>[919]</sup></a> has described the curious case of a
  crustacean in which one eye-peduncle supported, instead of a complete
  eye, only an imperfect cornea, out of the centre of which a portion of an
  antenna was developed. A case has been recorded<a name="NtA_920"
  href="#Nt_920"><sup>[920]</sup></a> of a man who had during both
  dentitions a double tooth in place of the left second incisor, and he
  inherited this peculiarity from his paternal grandfather. Several cases
  are known<a name="NtA_921" href="#Nt_921"><sup>[921]</sup></a> of
  additional teeth having been developed in the palate, more especially
  with horses, and in the orbit of the eye. Certain breeds of sheep bear a
  whole crowd of horns on their foreheads. Hairs occasionally appear in
  strange situations, as within the ears of the Siamese hairy family; and
  hairs "quite natural in structure" have been observed "within the
  substance of the brain."<a name="NtA_922"
  href="#Nt_922"><sup>[922]</sup></a> As many as five spurs have been seen
  on both legs in certain Game-fowls. In the Polish fowl the male is
  ornamented with a topknot of hackles <!-- Page 392 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page392"></a>{392}</span>like those on his neck,
  whilst the female has one of common feathers. In feather-footed pigeons
  and fowls, feathers like those on the wing arise from the outer side of
  the legs and toes. Even the elemental parts of the same feather may be
  transposed; for in the Sebastopol goose, barbules are developed on the
  divided filaments of the shaft.</p>

  <p>Analogous cases are of such frequent occurrence with plants that they
  do not strike us with sufficient surprise. Supernumerary petals, stamens,
  and pistils, are often produced. I have seen a leaflet low down in the
  compound leaf of <i>Vicia sativa</i> converted into a tendril, and a
  tendril possesses many peculiar properties, such as spontaneous movement
  and irritability. The calyx sometimes assumes, either wholly or by
  stripes, the colour and texture of the corolla. Stamens are so frequently
  converted, more or less completely, into petals, that such cases are
  passed over as not deserving notice; but as petals have special functions
  to perform, namely, to protect the included organs, to attract insects,
  and in not a few cases to guide their entrance by well-adapted
  contrivances, we can hardly account for the conversion of stamens into
  petals merely by unnatural or superfluous nourishment. Again, the edge of
  a petal may occasionally be found including one of the highest products
  of the plant, namely the pollen; for instance, I have seen in an Ophrys a
  pollen-mass with its curious structure of little packets, united together
  and to the caudicle by elastic threads, formed between the edges of an
  upper petal. The segments of the calyx of the common pea have been
  observed partially converted into carpels, including ovules, and with
  their tips converted into stigmas. Numerous analogous facts could be
  given.<a name="NtA_923" href="#Nt_923"><sup>[923]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I do not know how physiologists look at such facts as the foregoing.
  According to the doctrine of pangenesis, the free and superabundant
  gemmules of the transposed organs are developed in the wrong place, from
  uniting with wrong cells or aggregates of cells during their nascent
  state; and this would follow from a slight modification in the elective
  affinity of such cells, or possibly of certain gemmules. Nor ought we to
  feel much surprise at the affinities of cells and gemmules varying <!--
  Page 393 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page393"></a>{393}</span>under
  domestication, when we remember the many curious cases given, in the
  seventeenth chapter, of cultivated plants which absolutely refuse to be
  fertilised by their own pollen or by that of the same species, but are
  abundantly fertile with pollen of a distinct species; for this implies
  that their sexual elective affinities&mdash;and this is the term used by
  Gärtner&mdash;have been modified. As the cells of adjoining or homologous
  parts will have nearly the same nature, they will be liable to acquire by
  variation each other's elective affinities; and we can thus to a certain
  extent understand such cases as a crowd of horns on the heads in certain
  sheep, of several spurs on the leg, and of hackles on the head of the
  fowl, and with the pigeon the occurrence of wing-feathers on their legs
  and of membrane between their toes; for the leg is the homologue of the
  wing. As all the organs of plants are homologous and spring from a common
  axis, it is natural that they should be eminently liable to
  transposition. It ought to be observed that when any compound part, such
  as an additional limb or an antenna, springs from a false position, it is
  only necessary that the few first gemmules should be wrongly attached;
  for these whilst developing would attract others in due succession, as in
  the regrowth of an amputated limb. When parts which are homologous and
  similar in structure, as the vertebræ in snakes or the stamens in
  polyandrous flowers, &amp;c., are repeated many times in the same
  organism, closely allied gemmules must be extremely numerous, as well as
  the points to which they ought to become united; and, in accordance with
  the foregoing views, we can to a certain extent understand Isid. Geoffroy
  St. Hilaire's law, namely, that parts, which are already multiple, are
  extremely liable to vary in number.</p>

  <p>The same general principles apply to the fusion of homologous parts;
  and with respect to mere cohesion there is probably always some degree of
  fusion, at least near the surface. When two embryos during their early
  development come into close contact, as both include corresponding
  gemmules, which must be in all respects almost identical in nature, it is
  not surprising that some derived from one embryo and some from the other
  should unite at the point of contact with a single nascent cell or
  aggregate of cells, and thus give rise to a single part or organ. For
  instance, two embryos might thus come to have on their <!-- Page 394
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page394"></a>{394}</span>adjoining
  sides a single symmetrical arm, which in one sense will have been formed
  by the fusion of the bones, muscles, &amp;c., belonging to the arms of
  both embryos. In the case of the fish described by Lereboullet, in which
  a double head was seen gradually to fuse into a single one, the same
  process must have taken place, together with the absorption of all the
  parts which had been already formed. These cases are exactly the reverse
  of those in which a part is doubled either spontaneously or after an
  injury; for in the case of doubling, the superabundant gemmules of the
  same part are separately developed in union with adjoining points; whilst
  in the case of fusion the gemmules derived from two homologous parts
  become mingled and form a single part; or it may be that the gemmules
  from one of two adjoining embryos alone become developed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Variability often depends, as I have attempted to show, on the
  reproductive organs being injuriously affected by changed conditions; and
  in this case the gemmules derived from the various parts of the body are
  probably aggregated in an irregular manner, some superfluous and others
  deficient. Whether a superabundance of gemmules, together with fusion
  during development, would lead to the increased size of any part cannot
  be told; but we can see that their partial deficiency, without
  necessarily leading to the entire abortion of the part, might cause
  considerable modifications; for in the same manner as a plant, if its own
  pollen be excluded, is easily hybridised, so, in the case of a cell, if
  the properly succeeding gemmules were absent, it would probably combine
  easily with other and allied gemmules. We see this in the case of
  imperfect nails growing on the stumps of amputated fingers,<a
  name="NtA_924" href="#Nt_924"><sup>[924]</sup></a> for the gemmules of
  the nails have manifestly been developed at the nearest point.</p>

  <p>In variations caused by the direct action of changed conditions,
  whether of a definite or indefinite nature, as with the fleeces of sheep
  in hot countries, with maize grown in cold countries, with inherited
  gout, &amp;c., the tissues of the body, according to the doctrine of
  pangenesis, are directly affected by the new conditions, and consequently
  throw off modified gemmules, which are transmitted with their newly
  acquired peculiarities to the offspring. On any ordinary view it is
  unintelligible how changed <!-- Page 395 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page395"></a>{395}</span>conditions, whether acting on the embryo,
  the young or adult animal, can cause inherited modifications. It is
  equally or even more unintelligible on any ordinary view, how the effects
  of the long-continued use or disuse of any part, or of changed habits of
  body or mind, can be inherited. A more perplexing problem can hardly be
  proposed; but on our view we have only to suppose that certain cells
  become at last not only functionally but structurally modified; and that
  these throw off similarly modified gemmules. This may occur at any period
  of development, and the modification will be inherited at a corresponding
  period; for the modified gemmules will unite in all ordinary cases with
  the proper preceding cells, and they will consequently be developed at
  the same period at which the modification first arose. With respect to
  mental habits or instincts, we are so profoundly ignorant on the relation
  between the brain and the power of thought that we do not know whether an
  inveterate habit or trick induces any change in the nervous system; but
  when any habit or other mental attribute, or insanity, is inherited, we
  must believe that some actual modification is transmitted;<a
  name="NtA_925" href="#Nt_925"><sup>[925]</sup></a> and this implies,
  according to our hypothesis, that gemmules derived from modified
  nerve-cells are transmitted to the offspring.</p>

  <p>It is generally, perhaps always, necessary that an organism should be
  exposed during several generations to changed conditions or habits, in
  order that any modification in the structure of the offspring should
  ensue. This may be partly due to the changes not being at first marked
  enough to catch the attention, but this explanation is insufficient; and
  I can account for the fact, only by the assumption, which we shall see
  under the head of reversion is strongly supported, that gemmules derived
  from each cell before it had undergone the least modification are
  transmitted in large numbers to successive generations, but that the
  gemmules derived from the same cells after modification, naturally go on
  increasing under the same favouring conditions, until at last they become
  sufficiently numerous to overpower and supplant the old gemmules.</p>

  <p>Another difficulty may be here noticed; we have seen that <!-- Page
  396 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page396"></a>{396}</span>there is
  an important difference in the frequency, though not in the nature, of
  the variations in plants propagated by sexual and asexual generation. As
  far as variability depends on the imperfect action of the reproductive
  organs under changed conditions, we can at once see why seedlings should
  be far more variable than plants propagated by buds. We know that
  extremely slight causes,&mdash;for instance, whether a tree has been
  grafted or grows on its own stock, the position of the seeds within the
  capsule, and of the flowers on the spike,&mdash;sometimes suffice to
  determine the variation of a plant, when raised from seed. Now, it is
  probable, as explained when discussing alternate generation, that a bud
  is formed of a portion of already differentiated tissue; consequently an
  organism thus formed does not pass through the earlier phases of
  development, and cannot be so freely exposed, at the age when its
  structure would be most readily modified, to the various causes inducing
  variability; but it is very doubtful whether this is a sufficient
  explanation of the difficulty.</p>

  <p>With respect to the tendency to reversion, there is a similar
  difference between plants propagated from buds and seed. Many varieties,
  whether originally produced from seed or buds, can be securely propagated
  by buds, but generally or invariably revert by seed. So, also, hybridised
  plants can be multiplied to any extent by buds, but are continually
  liable to reversion by seed,&mdash;that is, to the loss of their hybrid
  or intermediate character. I can offer no satisfactory explanation of
  this fact. Here is a still more perplexing case: certain plants with
  variegated leaves, phloxes with striped flowers, barberries with seedless
  fruit, can all be securely propagated by the buds on cuttings; but the
  buds developed from the roots of these cuttings almost invariably lose
  their character and revert to their former condition.</p>

  <p>Finally, we can see on the hypothesis of pangenesis that variability
  depends on at least two distinct groups of causes. Firstly, on the
  deficiency, superabundance, fusion, and transposition of gemmules, and on
  the redevelopment of those which have long been dormant. In these cases
  the gemmules themselves have undergone no modification; but the mutations
  in the above respects will amply account for much fluctuating <!-- Page
  397 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page397"></a>{397}</span>variability. Secondly, in the cases in
  which the organisation has been modified by changed conditions, the
  increased use or disuse of parts, or any other cause, the gemmules cast
  off from the modified units of the body will be themselves modified, and,
  when sufficiently multiplied, will be developed into new and changed
  structures.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Turning now to Inheritance: if we suppose a homogeneous gelatinous
  protozoon to vary and assume a reddish colour, a minute separated atom we
  aid naturally, as it grew to full size, retain the same colour; and we
  should have the simplest form of inheritance.<a name="NtA_926"
  href="#Nt_926"><sup>[926]</sup></a> Precisely the same view may be
  extended to the infinitely numerous and diversified units of which the
  whole body in one of the higher animals is composed; and the separated
  atoms are our gemmules. We have already sufficiently discussed the
  inheritance of the direct effects of changed conditions, and of increased
  use or disuse of parts, and, by implication, the important principle of
  inheritance at corresponding ages. These groups of facts are to a large
  extent intelligible on the hypothesis of pangenesis, and on no other
  hypothesis as yet advanced.</p>

  <p>A few words must be added on the complete abortion or suppression of
  organs. When a part becomes diminished by disuse prolonged during many
  generations, the principle of economy of growth, as previously explained,
  will tend to reduce it still further; but this will not account for the
  complete or almost complete obliteration of, for instance, a minute
  papilla of cellular tissue representing a pistil, or of a microscopically
  minute nodule of bone representing a tooth. In certain cases of
  suppression not yet completed, in which a rudiment occasionally reappears
  through reversion, diffused gemmules derived from this part must,
  according to our view, still exist; hence we must suppose that the cells,
  in union with which the rudiment was formerly developed, in these cases
  fail in their affinity for such gemmules. But in the cases of complete
  and final abortion the gemmules themselves no doubt have perished; nor is
  this <!-- Page 398 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page398"></a>{398}</span>in any way improbable, for, though a vast
  number of active and long-dormant gemmules are diffused and nourished in
  each living creature, yet there must be some limit to their number; and
  it appears natural that gemmules derived from an enfeebled and useless
  rudiment would be more liable to perish than those derived from other
  parts which are still in full functional activity.</p>

  <p>With respect to mutilations, it is certain that a part may be removed
  or injured during many generations, and no inherited result follow; and
  this is an apparent objection to the hypothesis which will occur to every
  one. But, in the first place, a being can hardly be intentionally
  mutilated during its early stages of growth whilst in the womb or egg;
  and such mutilations, when naturally caused, would appear like congenital
  deficiencies, which are occasionally inherited. In the second place,
  according to our hypothesis, gemmules multiply by self-division and are
  transmitted from generation to generation; so that during a long period
  they would be present and ready to reproduce a part which was repeatedly
  amputated. Nevertheless it appears, from the facts given in the twelfth
  chapter, that in some rare cases mutilations have been inherited, but in
  most of these the mutilated surface became diseased. In this case it may
  be conjectured that the gemmules of the lost part were gradually all
  attracted by the partially diseased surface, and thus perished. Although
  this would occur in the injured individual alone, and therefore in only
  one parent, yet this might suffice for the inheritance of a mutilation,
  on the same principle that a hornless animal of either sex, when crossed
  with a perfect animal of the opposite sex, often transmits its
  deficiency.</p>

  <p>The last subject that need here be discussed, namely Reversion, rests
  on the principle that transmission and development, though generally
  acting in conjunction, are distinct powers; and the transmission of
  gemmules and their subsequent development show us how the existence of
  these two distinct powers is possible. We plainly see this distinction in
  the many cases in which a grandfather transmits to his grandson, through
  his daughter, characters which she does not, or cannot, possess. Why the
  development of certain characters, not necessarily in any way connected
  with the reproductive organs, should be confined to one sex
  alone&mdash;that is, why certain cells in one sex <!-- Page 399 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page399"></a>{399}</span>should unite with and
  cause the development of certain gemmules&mdash;we do not in the least
  know; but it is the common attribute of most organic beings in which the
  sexes are separate.</p>

  <p>The distinction between transmission and development is likewise seen
  in all ordinary cases of Reversion; but before discussing this subject it
  may be advisable to say a few words on those characters which I have
  called latent, and which would not be classed under Reversion in its
  usual sense. Most, or perhaps all, the secondary characters, which
  appertain to one sex, lie dormant in the other sex; that is, gemmules
  capable of development into the secondary male sexual characters are
  included within the female; and conversely female characters in the male.
  Why in the female, when her ovaria become diseased or fail to act,
  certain masculine gemmules become developed, we do not clearly know, any
  more than why when a young bull is castrated his horns continue growing
  until they almost resemble those of a cow; or why, when a stag is
  castrated, the gemmules derived from the antlers of his progenitors quite
  fail to be developed. But in many cases, with variable organic beings,
  the mutual affinities of the cells and gemmules become modified, so that
  parts are transposed or multiplied; and it would appear that a slight
  change in the constitution of an animal, in connection with the state of
  the reproductive organs, leads to changed affinities in the tissues of
  various parts of the body. Thus, when male animals first arrive at
  puberty, and subsequently during each recurrent season, certain cells or
  parts acquire an affinity for certain gemmules, which become developed
  into the secondary masculine characters; but if the reproductive organs
  be destroyed, or even temporarily disturbed by changed conditions, these
  affinities are not excited. Nevertheless, the male, before he arrives at
  puberty, and during the season when the species does not breed, must
  include the proper gemmules in a latent state. The curious case formerly
  given of a Hen which assumed the masculine characters, not of her own
  breed but of a remote progenitor, illustrates the connexion between
  latent sexual characters and ordinary reversion. With those animals and
  plants which habitually produce several forms, as with certain
  butterflies described by Mr. Wallace, in which three female forms and
  <!-- Page 400 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page400"></a>{400}</span>the male exist, or as with the trimorphic
  species of Lythrum and Oxalis, gemmules capable of reproducing several
  widely-different forms must be latent in each individual.</p>

  <p>The same principle of the latency of certain characters, combined with
  the transposition of organs, may be applied to those singular cases of
  butterflies and other insects, in which exactly one half or one quarter
  of the body resembles the male, and the other half or three quarters the
  female; and when this occurs the opposite sides of the body, separated
  from each other by a distinct line, sometimes differ in the most
  conspicuous manner. Again, these same principles apply to the cases given
  in the thirteenth chapter, in which the right and left sides of the body
  differ to an extraordinary degree, as in the spiral winding of certain
  shells, and as in the genus Verruca among cirripedes; for in these cases
  it is known that either side indifferently may undergo the same
  remarkable change of development.</p>

  <p>Reversion, in the ordinary sense of the word, comes into action so
  incessantly, that it evidently forms an essential part of the general law
  of inheritance. It occurs with beings, however propagated, whether by
  buds or seminal generation, and sometimes may even be observed in the
  same individual as it advances in age. The tendency to reversion is often
  induced by a change of conditions, and in the plainest manner by the act
  of crossing. Crossed forms are generally at first nearly intermediate in
  character between their two parents; but in the next generation the
  offspring generally revert to one or both of their grandparents, and
  occasionally to more remote ancestors. How can we account for these
  facts? Each organic unit in a hybrid must throw off, according to the
  doctrine of pangenesis, an abundance of hybridised gemmules, for crossed
  plants can be readily and largely propagated by buds; but by the same
  hypothesis there will likewise be present dormant gemmules derived from
  both pure parent-forms; and as these latter retain their normal
  condition, they would, it is probable, be enabled to multiply largely
  during the lifetime of each hybrid. Consequently the sexual elements of a
  hybrid will include both pure and hybridised gemmules; and when two
  hybrids pair, the combination of pure gemmules derived from the one
  hybrid with the pure gemmules of the same parts derived from the other
  would <!-- Page 401 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page401"></a>{401}</span>necessarily lead to complete reversion of
  character; and it is, perhaps, not too bold a supposition that unmodified
  and undeteriorated gemmules of the same nature would be especially apt to
  combine. Pure gemmules in combination with hybridised gemmules would lead
  to partial reversion. And lastly, hybridised gemmules derived from both
  parent-hybrids would simply reproduce the original hybrid form.<a
  name="NtA_927" href="#Nt_927"><sup>[927]</sup></a> All these cases and
  degrees of reversion incessantly occur.</p>

  <p>It was shown in the fifteenth chapter that certain characters are
  antagonistic to each other or do not readily blend together; hence, when
  two animals with antagonistic characters are crossed, it might well
  happen that a sufficiency of gemmules in the male alone for the
  reproduction of his peculiar characters, and in the female alone for the
  reproduction of her peculiar characters, would not be present; and in
  this case dormant gemmules derived from some remote progenitor might
  easily gain the ascendency, and cause the reappearance of long-lost
  characters. For instance, when black and white pigeons, or black and
  white fowls, are crossed,&mdash;colours which do not readily
  blend,&mdash;blue plumage in the one case, evidently derived from the
  rock-pigeon, and red plumage in the other case, derived from the wild
  jungle-cock, occasionally reappear. With uncrossed breeds the same result
  would follow, under conditions which favoured the multiplication and
  development of certain dormant gemmules, as when animals become feral and
  revert to their pristine character. A certain number of gemmules being
  requisite for the development of each character, as is known to be the
  case from several spermatozoa or pollen-grains being necessary for
  fertilisation, and time favouring their multiplication, will together
  account for the curious cases, insisted on by Mr. Sedgwick, of certain
  diseases regularly appearing in alternate generations. This likewise
  holds good, more or less strictly, with other weakly inherited
  modifications. Hence, as I have heard it remarked, certain diseases
  appear actually to gain strength by the intermission of a generation. The
  transmission of dormant gemmules during many successive generations is
  hardly in itself more improbable, as <!-- Page 402 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page402"></a>{402}</span>previously remarked,
  than the retention during many ages of rudimentary organs, or even only
  of a tendency to the production of a rudiment; but there is no reason to
  suppose that all dormant gemmules would be transmitted and propagated for
  ever. Excessively minute and numerous as they are believed to be, an
  infinite number derived, during a long course of modification and
  descent, from each cell of each progenitor, could not be supported or
  nourished by the organism. On the other hand, it does not seem improbable
  that certain gemmules, under favourable conditions, should be retained
  and go on multiplying for a longer period than others. Finally, on the
  views here given, we certainly gain some clear insight into the wonderful
  fact that the child may depart from the type of both its parents, and
  resemble its grandparents, or ancestors removed by many generations.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Conclusion.</i></p>

  <p>The hypothesis of Pangenesis, as applied to the several great classes
  of facts just discussed, no doubt is extremely complex; but so assuredly
  are the facts. The assumptions, however, on which the hypothesis rests
  cannot be considered as complex in any extreme degree&mdash;namely, that
  all organic units, besides having the power, as is generally admitted, of
  growing by self-division, throw off free and minute atoms of their
  contents, that is gemmules. These multiply and aggregate themselves into
  buds and the sexual elements; their development depends on their union
  with other nascent cells or units; and they are capable of transmission
  in a dormant state to successive generations.</p>

  <p>In a highly organised and complex animal, the gemmules thrown off from
  each different cell or unit throughout the body must be inconceivably
  numerous and minute. Each unit of each part, as it changes during
  development, and we know that some insects undergo at least twenty
  metamorphoses, must throw off its gemmules. All organic beings, moreover,
  include many dormant gemmules derived from their grandparents and more
  remote progenitors, but not from all their progenitors. These almost
  infinitely numerous and minute gemmules must be included in each bud,
  ovule, spermatozoon, and pollen-grain. Such an admission will be declared
  impossible; but, as previously <!-- Page 403 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page403"></a>{403}</span>remarked, number and size are only
  relative difficulties, and the eggs or seeds produced by certain animals
  or plants are so numerous that they cannot be grasped by the
  intellect.</p>

  <p>The organic particles with which the wind is tainted over miles of
  space by certain offensive animals must be infinitely minute and
  numerous; yet they strongly affect the olfactory nerves. An analogy more
  appropriate is afforded by the contagious particles of certain diseases,
  which are so minute that they float in the atmosphere and adhere to
  smooth paper; yet we know how largely they increase within the human
  body, and how powerfully they act. Independent organisms exist which are
  barely visible under the highest powers of our recently-improved
  microscopes, and which probably are fully as large as the cells or units
  in one of the higher animals; yet these organisms no doubt reproduce
  themselves by germs of extreme minuteness, relatively to their own minute
  size. Hence the difficulty, which at first appears insurmountable, of
  believing in the existence of gemmules so numerous and so small as they
  must be according to our hypothesis, has really little weight.</p>

  <p>The cells or units of the body are generally admitted by physiologists
  to be autonomous, like the buds on a tree, but in a less degree. I go one
  step further and assume that they throw off reproductive gemmules. Thus
  an animal does not, as a whole, generate its kind through the sole agency
  of the reproductive system, but each separate cell generates its kind. It
  has often been said by naturalists that each cell of a plant has the
  actual or potential capacity of reproducing the whole plant; but it has
  this power only in virtue of containing gemmules derived from every part.
  If our hypothesis be provisionally accepted, we must look at all the
  forms of asexual reproduction, whether occurring at maturity or as in the
  case of alternate generation during youth, as fundamentally the same, and
  dependent on the mutual aggregation and multiplication of the gemmules.
  The regrowth of an amputated limb or the healing of a wound is the same
  process partially carried out. Sexual generation differs in some
  important respects, chiefly, as it would appear, in an insufficient
  number of gemmules being aggregated within the separate sexual elements,
  and probably in the presence of certain primordial cells. The development
  of each being, including all the <!-- Page 404 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page404"></a>{404}</span>forms of metamorphosis
  and metagenesis, as well as the so-called growth of the higher animals,
  in which structure changes though not in a striking manner, depends on
  the presence of gemmules thrown off at each period of life, and on their
  development, at a corresponding period, in union with preceding cells.
  Such cells may be said to be fertilised by the gemmules which come next
  in the order of development. Thus the ordinary act of impregnation and
  the development of each being are closely analogous processes. The child,
  strictly speaking, does not grow into the man, but includes germs which
  slowly and successively become developed and form the man. In the child,
  as well as in the adult, each part generates the same part for the next
  generation. Inheritance must be looked at as merely a form of growth,
  like the self-division of a lowly-organised unicellular plant. Reversion
  depends on the transmission from the forefather to his descendants of
  dormant gemmules, which occasionally become developed under certain known
  or unknown conditions. Each animal and plant may be compared to a bed of
  mould full of seeds, most of which soon germinate, some lie for a period
  dormant, whilst others perish. When we hear it said that a man carries in
  his constitution the seeds of an inherited disease, there is much literal
  truth in the expression. Finally, the power of propagation possessed by
  each separate cell, using the term in its largest sense, determines the
  reproduction, the variability, the development and renovation of each
  living organism. No other attempt, as far as I am aware, has been made,
  imperfect as this confessedly is, to connect under one point of view
  these several grand classes of facts. We cannot fathom the marvellous
  complexity of an organic being; but on the hypothesis here advanced this
  complexity is much increased. Each living creature must be looked at as a
  microcosm&mdash;a little universe, formed of a host of self-propagating
  organisms, inconceivably minute and as numerous as the stars in
  heaven.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As summaries have been added to nearly all the chapters, and as, in
  the chapter on pangenesis, various subjects, such as the forms of
  reproduction, inheritance, reversion, the causes and laws of variability,
  &amp;c., have been recently discussed, I will here only make a few
  general remarks on the more important conclusions which may be deduced
  from the multifarious details given throughout this work.</p>

  <p>Savages in all parts of the world easily succeed in taming wild
  animals; and those inhabiting any country or island, when first invaded
  by man, would probably have been still more easily tamed. Complete
  subjugation generally depends on an animal being social in its habits,
  and on receiving man as the chief of the herd or family. Domestication
  implies almost complete fertility under new and changed conditions of
  life, and this is far from being invariably the case. An animal would not
  have been worth the labour of domestication, at least during early times,
  unless of service to man. From these circumstances the number of
  domesticated animals has never been large. With respect to plants, I have
  shown in the ninth chapter how their varied uses were probably first
  discovered, and the early steps in their cultivation. Man could not have
  known, when he first domesticated an animal or plant, whether it would
  flourish and multiply when transported to other countries, therefore he
  could not have been thus influenced in his choice. We see that the close
  adaptation of the reindeer and camel to extremely cold and hot countries
  has not prevented their domestication. Still less <!-- Page 406 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page406"></a>{406}</span>could man have foreseen
  whether his animals and plants would vary in succeeding generations and
  thus give birth to new races; and the small capacity of variability in
  the goose and ass has not prevented their domestication from the remotest
  epoch.</p>

  <p>With extremely few exceptions, all animals and plants which have been
  long domesticated, have varied greatly. It matters not under what
  climate, or for what purpose, they are kept, whether as food for man or
  beast, for draught or hunting, for clothing or mere pleasure,&mdash;under
  all these circumstances domesticated animals and plants have varied to a
  much greater extent than the forms which in a state of nature are ranked
  as one species. Why certain animals and plants have varied more under
  domestication than others we do not know, any more than why some are
  rendered more sterile than others under changed conditions of life. But
  we frequently judge of the amount of variation by the production of
  numerous and diversified races, and we can clearly see why in many cases
  this has not occurred, namely, because slight successive variations have
  not been steadily accumulated; and such variations will never be
  accumulated when an animal or plant is not closely observed, or much
  valued, or kept in large numbers.</p>

  <p>The fluctuating, and, as far as we can judge, never-ending variability
  of our domesticated productions,&mdash;the plasticity of their whole
  organisation,&mdash;is one of the most important facts which we learn
  from the numerous details given in the earlier chapters of this work. Yet
  domesticated animals and plants can hardly have been exposed to greater
  changes in their conditions than have many natural species during the
  incessant geological, geographical, and climatal changes of the whole
  world. The former will, however, commonly have been exposed to more
  sudden changes and to less continuously uniform conditions. As man has
  domesticated so many animals and plants belonging to widely different
  classes, and as he certainly did not with prophetic instinct choose those
  species which would vary most, we may infer that all natural species, if
  subjected to analogous conditions, would, on an average, vary to the same
  degree. Few men at the present day will maintain that animals and plants
  were created with a tendency to vary, which long remained dormant, in
  order that fanciers in after ages might <!-- Page 407 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page407"></a>{407}</span>rear, for instance,
  curious breeds of the fowl, pigeon, or canary-bird.</p>

  <p>From several causes it is difficult to judge of the amount of
  modification which our domestic productions have undergone. In some cases
  the primitive parent-stock has become extinct, or cannot be recognised
  with certainty owing to its supposed descendants having been so much
  modified. In other cases two or more closely allied forms, after being
  domesticated, have crossed; and then it is difficult to estimate how much
  of the change ought to be attributed to variation. But the degree to
  which our domestic breeds have been modified by the crossing of distinct
  natural forms has probably been exaggerated by some authors. A few
  individuals of one form would seldom permanently affect another form
  existing in much greater numbers; for, without careful selection, the
  stain of the foreign blood would soon be obliterated, and during early
  and barbarous times, when our animals were first domesticated, such care
  would seldom have been taken.</p>

  <p>There is good reason to believe that several of the breeds of the dog,
  ox, pig, and of some other animals, are respectively descended from
  distinct wild prototypes; nevertheless the belief in the multiple origin
  of our domesticated animals has been extended by some few naturalists and
  by many breeders to an unauthorised extent. Breeders refuse to look at
  the whole subject under a single point of view; I have heard one, who
  maintained that our fowls were the descendants of at least half-a-dozen
  aboriginal species, protest that he was in no way concerned with the
  origin of pigeons, ducks, rabbits, horses, or any other animal. They
  overlook the improbability of many species having been domesticated at an
  early and barbarous period. They do not consider the improbability of
  species having existed in a state of nature which, if like our present
  domestic breeds, would have been highly abnormal in comparison with all
  their congeners. They maintain that certain species, which formerly
  existed, have become extinct or unknown, although the world is now so
  much better known. The assumption of so much recent extinction is no
  difficulty in their eyes; for they do not judge of its probability by the
  facility or difficulty of the extinction of other closely allied wild
  forms. Lastly, <!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page408"></a>{408}</span>they often ignore the whole subject of
  geographical distribution as completely as if its laws were the result of
  chance.</p>

  <p>Although from the reasons just assigned it is often difficult to judge
  accurately of the amount of change which our domesticated productions
  have undergone, yet this can be ascertained in the cases in which we know
  that all the breeds are descended from a single species, as with the
  pigeon, duck, rabbit, and almost certainly with the fowl; and by the aid
  of analogy this is to a certain extent possible in the case of animals
  descended from several wild stocks. It is impossible to read the details
  given in the earlier chapters, and in many published works, or to visit
  our various exhibitions, without being deeply impressed with the extreme
  variability of our domesticated animals and cultivated plants. I have in
  many instances purposely given details on new and strange peculiarities
  which have arisen. No part of the organisation escapes the tendency to
  vary. The variations generally affect parts of small vital or
  physiological importance, but so it is with the differences which exist
  between closely allied species. In these unimportant characters there is
  often a greater difference between the breeds of the same species than
  between the natural species of the same genus, as Isidore Geoffroy has
  shown to be the case with size, and as is often the case with the colour,
  texture, form, &amp;c., of the hair, feathers, horns, and other dermal
  appendages.</p>

  <p>It has often been asserted that important parts never vary under
  domestication, but this is a complete error. Look at the skull of the pig
  in any one of the highly improved breeds, with the occipital condyles and
  other parts greatly modified; or look at that of the niata ox. Or again,
  in the several breeds of the rabbit, observe the elongated skull, with
  the differently shaped occipital foramen, atlas, and other cervical
  vertebræ. The whole shape of the brain, together with the skull, has been
  modified in Polish fowls; in other breeds of the fowl the number of the
  vertebræ and the forms of the cervical vertebræ have been changed. In
  certain pigeons the shape of the lower jaw, the relative length of the
  tongue, the size of the nostrils and eyelids, the number and shape of the
  ribs, the form and size of the &oelig;sophagus, have all varied. In
  certain quadrupeds the length of the intestines has been much increased
  or <!-- Page 409 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page409"></a>{409}</span>diminished. With plants we see wonderful
  differences in the stones of various fruits. In the Cucurbitaceæ several
  highly important characters have varied, such as the sessile position of
  the stigmas on the ovarium, the position of the carpels within the
  ovarium, and its projection out of the receptacle. But it would be
  useless to run through the many facts given in the earlier chapters.</p>

  <p>It is notorious how greatly the mental disposition, tastes, habits,
  consensual movements, loquacity or silence, and the tone of voice have
  varied and been inherited with our domesticated animals. The dog offers
  the most striking instance of changed mental attributes, and these
  differences cannot be accounted for by descent from distinct wild types.
  New mental characters have certainly often been acquired, and natural
  ones lost, under domestication.</p>

  <p>New characters may appear and disappear at any stage of growth, and be
  inherited at a corresponding period. We see this in the difference
  between the eggs of various breeds of the fowl, and in the down on
  chickens; and still more plainly in the differences between the
  caterpillars and cocoons of various breeds of the silk-moth. These facts,
  simple as they appear, throw light on the characters which distinguish
  the larval and adult states of natural species, and on the whole great
  subject of embryology. New characters are liable to become attached
  exclusively to that sex in which they first appeared, or they may be
  developed in a much higher degree in the one than the other sex; or
  again, after having become attached to one sex, they may be partially
  transferred to the opposite sex. These facts, and more especially the
  circumstance that new characters seem to be particularly liable, from
  some unknown cause, to become attached to the male sex, have an important
  bearing on the acquirement by animals in a state of nature of secondary
  sexual characters.</p>

  <p>It has sometimes been said that our domestic productions do not differ
  in constitutional peculiarities, but this cannot be maintained. In our
  improved cattle, pigs, &amp;c., the period of maturity, including that of
  the second dentition, has been much hastened. The period of gestation
  varies much, but has been modified in a fixed manner in only one or two
  cases. In <!-- Page 410 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page410"></a>{410}</span>our poultry and pigeons the acquirement of
  down and of the first plumage by the young, and of the secondary sexual
  characters by the males, differ. The number of moults through which the
  larvæ of silk-moths pass, varies. The tendency to fatten, to yield much
  milk, to produce many young or eggs at a birth or during life, differs in
  different breeds. We find different degrees of adaptation to climate, and
  different tendencies to certain diseases, to the attacks of parasites,
  and to the action of certain vegetable poisons. With plants, adaptation
  to certain soils, as with some kinds of plums, the power of resisting
  frost, the period of flowering and fruiting, the duration of life, the
  period of shedding the leaves and of retaining them throughout the
  winter, the proportion and nature of certain chemical compounds in the
  tissues or seeds, all vary.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one important constitutional difference between
  domestic races and species; I refer to the sterility which almost
  invariably follows, in a greater or less degree, when species are
  crossed, and to the perfect fertility of the most distinct domestic
  races, with the exception of a very few plants, when similarly crossed.
  It certainly appears a remarkable fact that many closely allied species
  which in appearance differ extremely little should yield when united only
  a few, more or less sterile offspring, or none at all; whilst domestic
  races which differ conspicuously from each other, are when united
  remarkably fertile, and yield perfectly fertile offspring. But this fact
  is not in reality so inexplicable as it at first appears. In the first
  place, it was clearly shown in the nineteenth chapter that the sterility
  of crossed species does not closely depend on differences in their
  external structure or general constitution, but results exclusively from
  differences in the reproductive system, analogous with those which cause
  the lessened fertility of the illegitimate unions and illegitimate
  offspring of dimorphic and trimorphic plants. In the second place, the
  Pallasian doctrine, that species after having been long domesticated lose
  their natural tendency to sterility when crossed, has been shown to be
  highly probable; we can scarcely avoid this conclusion when we reflect on
  the parentage and present fertility of the several breeds of the dog, of
  Indian and European cattle, sheep, and pigs. Hence it would be
  unreasonable to expect that races formed under domestication <!-- Page
  411 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page411"></a>{411}</span>should
  acquire sterility when crossed, whilst at the same time we admit that
  domestication eliminates the normal sterility of crossed species. Why
  with closely allied species their reproductive systems should almost
  invariably have been modified in so peculiar a manner as to be mutually
  incapable of acting on each other&mdash;though in unequal degrees in the
  two sexes, as shown by the difference in fertility between reciprocal
  crosses in the same species&mdash;we do not know, but may with much
  probability infer the cause to be as follows. Most natural species have
  been habituated to nearly uniform conditions of life for an incomparably
  longer period of time than have domestic races; and we positively know
  that changed conditions exert an especial and powerful influence on the
  reproductive system. Hence this difference in habituation may well
  account for the different action of the reproductive organs when domestic
  races and when species are crossed. It is a nearly analogous fact, that
  most domestic races may be suddenly transported from one climate to
  another, or be placed under widely different conditions, and yet retain
  their fertility unimpaired; whilst a multitude of species subjected to
  lesser changes are rendered incapable of breeding.</p>

  <p>With the exception of fertility, domestic varieties resemble species
  when crossed in transmitting their characters in the same unequal manner
  to their offspring, in being subject to the prepotency of one form over
  the other, and in their liability to reversion. By repeated crosses a
  variety or a species may be made completely to absorb another. Varieties,
  as we shall see when we treat of their antiquity, sometimes inherit their
  new characters almost, or even quite, as firmly as species. With both,
  the conditions leading to variability and the laws governing its nature
  appear to be the same. Domestic varieties can be classed in groups under
  groups, like species under genera, and these under families and orders;
  and the classification may be either artificial,&mdash;that is, founded
  on any arbitrary character,&mdash;or natural. With varieties a natural
  classification is certainly founded, and with species is apparently
  founded, on community of descent, together with the amount of
  modification which the forms have undergone. The characters by which
  domestic varieties differ from each other are more <!-- Page 412 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page412"></a>{412}</span>variable than those
  distinguishing species, though hardly more so than with certain protean
  species; but this greater degree of variability is not surprising, as
  varieties have generally been exposed within recent times to fluctuating
  conditions of life, are much more liable to have been crossed, and are
  still in many cases undergoing, or have recently undergone, modification
  by man's methodical or unconscious selection.</p>

  <p>Domestic varieties as a general rule certainly differ from each other
  in less important parts of their organisation than do species; and when
  important differences occur, they are seldom firmly fixed; but this fact
  is intelligible if we consider man's method of selection. In the living
  animal or plant he cannot observe internal modifications in the more
  important organs; nor does he regard them as long as they are compatible
  with health and life. What does the breeder care about any slight change
  in the molar teeth of his pigs, or for an additional molar tooth in the
  dog; or for any change in the intestinal canal or other internal organ?
  The breeder cares for the flesh of his cattle being well marbled with
  fat, and for an accumulation of fat within the abdomen of his sheep, and
  this he has effected. What would the floriculturist care for any change
  in the structure of the ovarium or of the ovules? As important internal
  organs are certainly liable to numerous slight variations, and as these
  would probably be inherited, for many strange monstrosities are
  transmitted, man could undoubtedly effect a certain amount of change in
  these organs. When he has produced any modification in an important part,
  it has generally been unintentionally in correlation with some other
  conspicuous part, as when he has given ridges and protuberances to the
  skulls of fowls, by attending to the form of the comb, and in the case of
  the Polish fowl to the plume of feathers on the head. By attending to the
  external form of the pouter-pigeon, he has enormously increased the size
  of the &oelig;sophagus, and has added to the number of the ribs, and
  given them greater breadth. With the carrier-pigeon, by increasing,
  through steady selection, the wattles on the upper mandible, he has
  greatly modified the form of the lower mandible; and so in many other
  cases. Natural species, on the other hand, have been modified exclusively
  for their own good, to fit them for infinitely <!-- Page 413 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page413"></a>{413}</span>diversified conditions
  of life, to avoid enemies of all kinds, and to struggle against a host of
  competitors. Hence, under such complex conditions, it would often happen
  that modifications of the most varied kinds, in important as well as in
  unimportant parts, would be advantageous or even necessary; and they
  would slowly but surely be acquired through the survival of the fittest.
  Various indirect modifications would likewise arise through the law of
  correlated variation.</p>

  <p>Domestic breeds often have an abnormal or semi-monstrous character, as
  the Italian greyhound, bulldog, Blenheim spaniel, and bloodhound amongst
  dogs,&mdash;some breeds of cattle and pigs, several breeds of the fowl,
  and the chief breeds of the pigeon. The differences between such abnormal
  breeds occur in parts which in closely-allied natural species differ but
  slightly or not at all. This may be accounted for by man's often
  selecting, especially at first, conspicuous and semi-monstrous deviations
  of structure. We should, however, be cautious in deciding what deviations
  ought to be called monstrous: there can hardly be a doubt that, if the
  brush of horse-like hair on the breast of the turkey-cock had first
  appeared on the domesticated bird, it would have been considered a
  monstrosity; the great plume of feathers on the head of the Polish cock
  has been thus designated, though plumes are common with many kinds of
  birds; we might call the wattle or corrugated skin round the base of the
  beak of the English carrier-pigeon a monstrosity, but we do not thus
  speak of the globular fleshy excrescence at the base of the beak of the
  male <i>Carpophaga oceanica</i>.</p>

  <p>Some authors have drawn a wide distinction between artificial and
  natural breeds; although in extreme cases the distinction is plain, in
  many other cases an arbitrary line has to be drawn. The difference
  depends chiefly on the kind of selection which has been applied.
  Artificial breeds are those which have been intentionally improved by
  man; they frequently have an unnatural appearance, and are especially
  liable to loss of excellence through reversion and continued variability.
  The so-called natural breeds, on the other hand, are those which are now
  found in semi-civilised countries, and which formerly inhabited separate
  districts in nearly all the European kingdoms. They have been rarely
  acted on by man's <!-- Page 414 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page414"></a>{414}</span>intentional selection; more frequently, it
  is probable, by unconscious selection, and partly by natural selection,
  for animals kept in semi-civilised countries have to provide largely for
  their own wants. Such natural breeds will also, it may be presumed, have
  been directly acted on to some extent by the differences, though slight,
  in the surrounding physical conditions.</p>

  <p>It is a much more important distinction that some breeds have been
  from their first origin modified in so slow and insensible a manner, that
  if we could see their early progenitors we should hardly be able to say
  when or how the breed first arose; whilst other breeds have originated
  from a strongly-marked or semi-monstrous deviation of structure, which,
  however, may subsequently have been augmented by selection. From what we
  know of the history of the racehorse, greyhound, gamecock, &amp;c., and
  from their general appearance, we may feel nearly confident that they
  were formed by a slow process of improvement: and with the
  carrier-pigeon, as well as with some other pigeons, we know that this has
  been the case. On the other hand, it is certain that the ancon and
  mauchamp breeds of sheep, and almost certain that the niata cattle,
  turnspit and pug-dogs, jumper and frizzled fowls, short-faced tumbler
  pigeons, hook-billed ducks, &amp;c., and with plants a multitude of
  varieties, suddenly appeared in nearly the same state as we now see them.
  The frequency of these cases is likely to lead to the false belief that
  natural species have often originated in the same abrupt manner. But we
  have no evidence of the appearance, or at least of the continued
  procreation, under nature, of abrupt modifications of structure; and
  various general reasons could be assigned against such a belief: for
  instance, without separation a single monstrous variation would almost
  certainly be soon obliterated by crossing.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, we have abundant evidence of the constant
  occurrence under nature of slight individual differences of the most
  diversified kinds; and thus we are led to conclude that species have
  generally originated by the natural selection, not of abrupt
  modifications, but of extremely slight differences. This process may be
  strictly compared with the slow and gradual improvement of the racehorse,
  greyhound, and gamecock. As every detail of structure in each species is
  closely adapted to its general <!-- Page 415 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page415"></a>{415}</span>habits of life, it will rarely happen that
  one part alone will be modified; but the co-adapted modifications, as
  formerly shown, need not be absolutely simultaneous. Many variations,
  however, are from the first connected by the law of correlation. Hence it
  follows that even closely-allied species rarely or never differ from each
  other by some one character alone; and this same remark applies to a
  certain extent to domestic races; for these, if they differ much,
  generally differ in many respects.</p>

  <p>Some naturalists boldly insist<a name="NtA_928"
  href="#Nt_928"><sup>[928]</sup></a> that species are absolutely distinct
  productions, never passing by intermediate links into each other; whilst
  they maintain that domestic varieties can always be connected either with
  each other or with their parent-forms. But if we could always find the
  links between the several breeds of the dog, horse, cattle, sheep, pigs,
  &amp;c., the incessant doubts whether they are descended from one or
  several species would not have arisen. The greyhound genus, if such a
  term may be used, cannot be closely connected with any other breed,
  unless, perhaps, we go back to the ancient Egyptian monuments. Our
  English bulldog also forms a very distinct breed. In all these cases
  crossed breeds must of course be excluded, for the most distinct natural
  species can thus be connected. By what links can the Cochin fowl be
  closely united with others? By searching for breeds still preserved in
  distant lands, and by going back to historical records, tumbler-pigeons,
  carriers, and barbs can be closely connected with the parent rock-pigeon;
  but we cannot thus connect the turbit or the pouter. The degree of
  distinctness between the various domestic breeds depends on the amount of
  modification which they have undergone, and especially on the neglect and
  final extinction of the linking, intermediate, and less valued forms.</p>

  <p>It has often been argued that no light is thrown, from the admitted
  changes of domestic races, on the changes which natural species are
  believed to undergo, as the former are said to be mere temporary
  productions, always reverting, as soon as they become feral, to their
  pristine form. This argument has been well combated by Mr. Wallace;<a
  name="NtA_929" href="#Nt_929"><sup>[929]</sup></a> and full details were
  given in the thirteenth chapter, showing that the tendency to reversion
  in feral <!-- Page 416 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page416"></a>{416}</span>animals and plants has been greatly
  exaggerated, though no doubt to a certain extent it exists. It would be
  opposed to all the principles inculcated in this work, if domestic
  animals, when exposed to new conditions and compelled to struggle for
  their own wants against a host of foreign competitors, were not in the
  course of time in some manner modified. It should also be remembered that
  many characters lie latent in all organic beings ready to be evolved
  under fitting conditions; and in breeds modified within recent times the
  tendency to reversion is particularly strong. But the antiquity of
  various breeds clearly proves that they remain nearly constant as long as
  their conditions of life remain the same.</p>

  <p>It has been boldly maintained by some authors that the amount of
  variation to which our domestic productions are liable is strictly
  limited; but this is an assertion resting on little evidence. Whether or
  not the amount in any particular direction is fixed, the tendency to
  general variability seems unlimited. Cattle, sheep, and pigs have been
  domesticated and have varied from the remotest period, as shown by the
  researches of Rütimeyer and others, yet these animals have, within quite
  recent times, been improved in an unparalleled degree; and this implies
  continued variability of structure. Wheat, as we know from the remains
  found in the Swiss lake-habitations, is one of the most anciently
  cultivated plants, yet at the present day new and better varieties
  occasionally arise. It may be that an ox will never be produced of larger
  size or finer proportions than our present animals, or a race-horse
  fleeter than Eclipse, or a gooseberry larger than the London variety; but
  he would be a bold man who would assert that the extreme limit in these
  respects has been finally attained. With flowers and fruit it has
  repeatedly been asserted that perfection has been reached, but the
  standard has soon been excelled. A breed of pigeons may never be produced
  with a beak shorter than that of the present short-faced tumbler, or with
  one longer than that of the English carrier, for these birds have weak
  constitutions and are bad breeders; but the shortness and length of the
  beak are the points which have been steadily improved during at least the
  last 150 years; and some of the best judges deny that the goal has yet
  been reached. We may, also, reasonably suspect, from what <!-- Page 417
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page417"></a>{417}</span>we see in
  natural species of the variability of extremely modified parts, that any
  structure, after remaining constant during a long series of generations,
  would, under new and changed conditions of life, recommence its course of
  variability, and might again be acted on by selection. Nevertheless, as
  Mr. Wallace<a name="NtA_930" href="#Nt_930"><sup>[930]</sup></a> has
  recently remarked with much force and truth, there must be both with
  natural and domestic productions a limit to change in certain directions;
  for instance, there must be a limit to the fleetness of any terrestrial
  animal, as this will be determined by the friction to be overcome, the
  weight to be carried, and the power of contraction in the muscular
  fibres. The English racehorse may have reached this limit; but it already
  surpasses in fleetness its own wild progenitor, and all other equine
  species.</p>

  <p>It is not surprising, seeing the great difference between many
  domestic breeds, that some few naturalists have concluded that all are
  descended from distinct aboriginal stocks, more especially as the
  principle of selection has been ignored, and the high antiquity of man,
  as a breeder of animals, has only recently become known. Most
  naturalists, however, freely admit that various extremely dissimilar
  breeds are descended from a single stock, although they do not know much
  about the art of breeding, cannot show the connecting links, nor say
  where and when the breeds arose. Yet these same naturalists will declare,
  with an air of philosophical caution, that they can never admit that one
  natural species has given birth to another until they behold all the
  transitional steps. But fanciers have used exactly the same language with
  respect to domestic breeds; thus an author of an excellent treatise says
  he will never allow that carrier and fantail pigeons are the descendants
  of the wild rock-pigeon, until the transitions have "actually been
  observed, and can be repeated whenever man chooses to set about the
  task." No doubt it is difficult to realise that slight changes added up
  during long centuries can produce such results; but he who wishes to
  understand the origin of domestic breeds or natural species must overcome
  this difficulty.</p>

  <p>The causes inducing and the laws governing variability have been so
  lately discussed, that I need here only enumerate the leading points. As
  domesticated organisms are much more <!-- Page 418 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page418"></a>{418}</span>liable to slight
  deviations of structure and to monstrosities, than species living under
  their natural conditions, and as widely-ranging species vary more than
  those which inhabit restricted areas, we may infer that variability
  mainly depends on changed conditions of life. We must not overlook the
  effects of the unequal combination of the characters derived from both
  parents, nor reversion to former progenitors. Changed conditions have an
  especial tendency to render the reproductive organs more or less
  impotent, as shown in the chapter devoted to this subject; and these
  organs consequently often fail to transmit faithfully the parental
  characters. Changed conditions also act directly and definitely on the
  organisation, so that all or nearly all the individuals of the same
  species thus exposed become modified in the same manner; but why this or
  that part is especially affected we can seldom or never say. In most
  cases, however, of the direct action of changed conditions, independently
  of the indirect variability caused by the reproductive organs being
  affected, indefinite modifications are the result; in nearly the same
  manner as exposure to cold or the absorption of the same poison affects
  different individuals in various ways. We have reason to suspect that an
  habitual excess of highly nutritious food, or an excess relatively to the
  wear and tear of the organisation from exercise, is a powerful exciting
  cause of variability. When we see the symmetrical and complex outgrowths,
  caused by a minute atom of the poison of a gall-insect, we may believe
  that slight changes in the chemical nature of the sap or blood would lead
  to extraordinary modifications of structure.</p>

  <p>The increased use of a muscle with its various attached parts, and the
  increased activity of a gland or other organ, lead to their increased
  development. Disuse has a contrary effect. With domesticated productions
  organs sometimes become rudimentary through abortion; but we have no
  reason to suppose that this has ever followed from mere disuse. With
  natural species, on the contrary, many organs appear to have been
  rendered rudimentary through disuse, aided by the principle of the
  economy of growth, and by the hypothetical principle discussed in the
  last chapter, namely, the final destruction of the germs or gemmules of
  such useless parts. This difference may be partly <!-- Page 419 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page419"></a>{419}</span>accounted for by disuse
  having acted on domestic forms for an insufficient length of time, and
  partly from their exemption from any severe struggle for existence,
  entailing rigid economy in the development of each part, to which all
  species under nature are subjected. Nevertheless the law of compensation
  or balancement apparently affects, to a certain extent, our domesticated
  productions.</p>

  <p>We must not exaggerate the importance of the definite action of
  changed conditions in modifying all the individuals of the same species
  in the same manner, or of use and disuse. As every part of the
  organisation is highly variable, and as variations are so easily
  selected, both consciously and unconsciously, it is very difficult to
  distinguish between the effects of the selection of indefinite
  variations, and the direct action of the conditions of life. For
  instance, it is possible that the feet of our water-dogs, and of the
  American dogs which have to travel much over the snow, may have become
  partially webbed from the stimulus of widely extending their toes; but it
  is far more probable that the webbing, like the membrane between the toes
  of certain pigeons, spontaneously appeared and was afterwards increased
  by the best swimmers and the best snow-travellers being preserved during
  many generations. A fancier who wished to decrease the size of his
  bantams or tumbler-pigeons would never think of starving them, but would
  select the smallest individuals which spontaneously appeared. Quadrupeds
  are sometimes born destitute of hair, and hairless breeds have been
  formed, but there is no reason to believe that this is caused by a hot
  climate. Within the tropics heat often causes sheep to lose their
  fleeces, and on the other hand wet and cold act as a direct stimulus to
  the growth of hair; it is, however, possible that these changes may
  merely be an exaggeration of the regular yearly change of coat; and who
  will pretend to decide how far this yearly change, or the thick fur of
  arctic animals, or as I may add their white colour, is due to the direct
  action of a severe climate, and how far to the preservation of the best
  protected individuals during a long succession of generations?</p>

  <p>Of all the laws governing variability, that of correlation is the most
  important. In many cases of slight deviations of structure as well as of
  grave monstrosities, we cannot even <!-- Page 420 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page420"></a>{420}</span>conjecture what is the
  nature of the bond of connexion. But between homologous
  parts&mdash;between the fore and hind limbs&mdash;between the hair,
  hoofs, horns, and teeth&mdash;we can see that parts which are closely
  similar during their early development, and which are exposed to similar
  conditions, would be liable to be modified in the same manner. Homologous
  parts, from having the same nature, are apt to blend together and, when
  many exist, to vary in number.</p>

  <p>Although every variation is either directly or indirectly caused by
  some change in the surrounding conditions, we must never forget that the
  nature of the organisation which is acted on essentially governs the
  result. Distinct organisms, when placed under similar conditions, vary in
  different manners, whilst closely-allied organisms under dissimilar
  conditions often vary in nearly the same manner. We see this in the same
  modification frequently reappearing at long intervals of time in the same
  variety, and likewise in the several striking cases given of analogous or
  parallel varieties. Although some of these latter cases are simply due to
  reversion, others cannot thus be accounted for.</p>

  <p>From the indirect action of changed conditions on the organisation,
  through the impaired state of the reproductive organs&mdash;from the
  direct action of such conditions (and this will cause the individuals of
  the same species either to vary in the same manner, or differently in
  accordance with slight differences in their constitution)&mdash;from the
  effects of the increased or decreased use of parts,&mdash;and from
  correlation,&mdash;the variability of our domesticated productions is
  complicated in an extreme degree. The whole organisation becomes slightly
  plastic. Although each modification must have its proper exciting cause,
  and though each is subjected to law, yet we can so rarely trace the
  precise relation between cause and effect, that we are tempted to speak
  of variations as if they spontaneously arose. We may even call them
  accidental, but this must be only in the sense in which we say that a
  fragment of rock dropped from a height owes its shape to accident.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It may be worth while briefly to consider the results of the exposure
  to unnatural conditions of a large number of animals of the same species,
  allowed to cross freely, with no selection of any <!-- Page 421 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page421"></a>{421}</span>kind; and afterwards to
  consider the results when selection is brought into play. Let us suppose
  that 500 wild rock-pigeons were confined in their native land in an
  aviary, and fed in the same manner as pigeons usually are; and that they
  were not allowed to increase in number. As pigeons propagate so rapidly,
  I suppose that a thousand or fifteen hundred birds would have to be
  annually killed by mere chance. After several generations had been thus
  reared, we may feel sure that some of the young birds would vary, and the
  variations would tend to be inherited; for at the present day slight
  deviations of structure often occur, but, as most breeds are already well
  established, these modifications are rejected as blemishes. It would be
  tedious even to enumerate the multitude of points which still go on
  varying or have recently varied. Many variations would occur in
  correlation, as the length of the wing and tail feathers&mdash;the number
  of the primary wing-feathers, as well as the number and breadth of the
  ribs, in correlation with the size and form of the body&mdash;the number
  of the scutellæ, with the size of the feet&mdash;the length of the
  tongue, with the length of the beak&mdash;the size of the nostrils and
  eyelids and the form of lower jaw in correlation with the development of
  wattle&mdash;the nakedness of the young with the future colour of the
  plumage&mdash;the size of the feet and beak, and other such points.
  Lastly, as our birds are supposed to be confined in an aviary, they would
  use their wings and legs but little, and certain parts of the skeleton,
  such as the sternum and scapulæ and the feet, would in consequence become
  slightly reduced in size.</p>

  <p>As in our assumed case many birds have to be indiscriminately killed
  every year, the chances are against any new variety surviving long enough
  to breed. And as the variations which arise are of an extremely
  diversified nature, the chances are very great against two birds pairing
  which have varied in the same manner; nevertheless, a varying bird even
  when not thus paired would occasionally transmit its character to its
  young; and these would not only be exposed to the same conditions which
  first caused the variation in question to appear, but would in addition
  inherit from their one modified parent a tendency again to vary in the
  same manner. So that, if the conditions decidedly tended to induce some
  particular variation, all the birds might <!-- Page 422 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page422"></a>{422}</span>in the course of time
  become similarly modified. But a far commoner result would be, that one
  bird would vary in one way and another bird in another way; one would be
  born with a little longer beak, and another with a shorter beak; one
  would gain some black feathers, another some white or red feathers. And
  as these birds would be continually intercrossing, the final result would
  be a body of individuals differing from each other slightly in many ways,
  yet far more than did the original rock-pigeons. But there would not be
  the least tendency to the formation of distinct breeds.</p>

  <p>If two separate lots of pigeons were to be treated in the manner just
  described, one in England and the other in a tropical country, the two
  lots being supplied with different food, would they, after many
  generations had passed, differ? When we reflect on the cases given in the
  twenty-third chapter, and on such facts as the difference in former times
  between the breeds of cattle, sheep, &amp;c., in almost every district of
  Europe, we are strongly inclined to admit that the two lots would be
  differently modified through the influence of climate and food. But the
  evidence on the definite action of changed conditions is in most cases
  insufficient; and, with respect to pigeons, I have had the opportunity of
  examining a large collection of domesticated birds, sent to me by Sir W.
  Elliot from India, and they varied in a remarkably similar manner with
  our European birds.</p>

  <p>If two distinct breeds were to be confined together in equal numbers,
  there is reason to suspect that they would to a certain extent prefer
  pairing with their own kind; but they would likewise intercross. From the
  greater vigour and fertility of the crossed offspring, the whole body
  would by this means become interblended sooner than would otherwise have
  occurred. From certain breeds being prepotent over others, it does not
  follow that the interblended progeny would be strictly intermediate in
  character. I have, also, proved that the act of crossing in itself gives
  a strong tendency to reversion, so that the crossed offspring would tend
  to revert to the state of the aboriginal rock-pigeon. In the course of
  time they would probably be not much more heterogeneous in character than
  in our first case, when birds of the same breed were confined together.
  <!-- Page 423 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page423"></a>{423}</span></p>

  <p>I have just said that the crossed offspring would gain in vigour and
  fertility. From the facts given in the seventeenth chapter there can be
  no doubt of this; and there can be little doubt, though the evidence on
  this head is not so easily acquired, that long-continued close
  interbreeding leads to evil results. With hermaphrodites of all kinds, if
  the sexual elements of the same individual habitually acted on each
  other, the closest possible interbreeding would be perpetual. Therefore
  we should bear in mind that with all hermaphrodite animals, as far as I
  can learn, their structure permits and frequently necessitates a cross
  with a distinct individual. With hermaphrodite plants we incessantly meet
  with elaborate and perfect contrivances for this same end. It is no
  exaggeration to assert that, if the use of the talons and tusks of a
  carnivorous animal, or the use of the viscid threads of a spider's web,
  or of the plumes and hooks on a seed may be safely inferred from their
  structure, we may with equal safety infer that many flowers are
  constructed for the express purpose of ensuring a cross with a distinct
  plant. From these various considerations, the conclusion arrived at in
  the chapter just referred to&mdash;namely, that great good of some kind
  is derived from the sexual concourse of distinct individuals&mdash;must
  be admitted.</p>

  <p>To return to our illustration: we have hitherto assumed that the birds
  were kept down to the same number by indiscriminate slaughter; but if the
  least choice be permitted in their preservation and slaughter, the whole
  result will be changed. Should the owner observe any slight variation in
  one of his birds, and wish to obtain a breed thus characterised, he would
  succeed in a surprisingly short time by carefully selecting and pairing
  the young. As any part which has once varied generally goes on varying in
  the same direction, it is easy, by continually preserving the most
  strongly marked individuals, to increase the amount of difference up to a
  high, predetermined standard of excellence. This is methodical
  selection.</p>

  <p>If the owner of the aviary, without any thought of making a new breed,
  simply admired, for instance, short-beaked more than long-beaked birds,
  he would, when he had to reduce the number, generally kill the latter;
  and there can be no doubt that he would thus in the course of time
  sensibly modify his <!-- Page 424 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page424"></a>{424}</span>stock. It is improbable, if two men were
  to keep pigeons and act in this manner, that they would prefer exactly
  the same characters; they would, as we know, often prefer directly
  opposite characters, and the two lots would ultimately come to differ.
  This has actually occurred with strains or families of cattle, sheep, and
  pigeons, which have been long kept and carefully attended to by different
  breeders without any wish on their part to form new and distinct
  sub-breeds. This unconscious kind of selection will more especially come
  into action with animals which are highly serviceable to man; for every
  one tries to get the best dog, horse, cow, or sheep, and these animals
  will transmit more or less surely their good qualities to their
  offspring. Hardly any one is so careless as to breed from his worst
  animals. Even savages, when compelled from extreme want to kill some of
  their animals, would destroy the worst and preserve the best. With
  animals kept for use and not for mere amusement, different fashions
  prevail in different districts, leading to the preservation, and
  consequently to the transmission, of all sorts of trifling peculiarities
  of character. The same process will have been pursued with our
  fruit-trees and vegetables, for the best will always have been the most
  largely cultivated, and will occasionally have yielded seedlings better
  than their parents.</p>

  <p>The different strains, just alluded to, which have been raised by
  different breeders without any wish for such a result, and the
  unintentional modification of foreign breeds in their new homes, both
  afford excellent evidence of the power of unconscious selection. This
  form of selection has probably led to far more important results than
  methodical selection, and is likewise more important under a theoretical
  point of view from closely resembling natural selection. For during this
  process the best or most valued individuals are not separated and
  prevented crossing with others of the same breed, but are simply
  preferred and preserved; but this inevitably leads during a long
  succession of generations to their increase in number and to their
  gradual improvement; so that finally they prevail to the exclusion of the
  old parent-form.</p>

  <p>With our domesticated animals natural selection checks the production
  of races with any injurious deviation of <!-- Page 425 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page425"></a>{425}</span>structure. In the case
  of animals kept by savages and semi-civilised people, which have to
  provide largely for their own wants under different circumstances,
  natural selection will probably play a more important part. Hence such
  animals often closely resemble natural species.</p>

  <p>As there is no limit to man's desire to possess animals and plants
  more and more useful in any respect, and as the fancier always wishes,
  from fashion running into extremes, to produce each character more and
  more strongly pronounced, there is a constant tendency in every breed,
  through the prolonged action of methodical and unconscious selection, to
  become more and more different from its parent-stock; and when several
  breeds have been produced and are valued for different qualities, to
  differ more and more from each other. This leads to Divergence of
  Character. As improved sub-varieties and races are slowly formed, the
  older and less improved breeds are neglected and decrease in number. When
  few individuals of any breed exist within the same locality, close
  interbreeding, by lessening their vigour and fertility, aids in their
  final extinction. Thus the intermediate links are lost, and breeds which
  have already diverged gain Distinctness of Character.</p>

  <p>In the chapters on the Pigeon, it was proved by historical details and
  by the existence of connecting sub-varieties in distant lands that
  several breeds have steadily diverged in character, and that many old and
  intermediate sub-breeds have become extinct. Other cases could be adduced
  of the extinction of domestic breeds, as of the Irish wolf-dog, the old
  English hound, and of two breeds in France, one of which was formerly
  highly valued.<a name="NtA_931" href="#Nt_931"><sup>[931]</sup></a> Mr.
  Pickering remarks<a name="NtA_932" href="#Nt_932"><sup>[932]</sup></a>
  that "the sheep figured on the most ancient Egyptian monuments is unknown
  at the present day; and at least one variety of the bullock, formerly
  known in Egypt, has in like manner become extinct." So it has been with
  some animals, and with several plants cultivated by the ancient
  inhabitants of Europe during the neolithic period. In Peru, Von Tschudi<a
  name="NtA_933" href="#Nt_933"><sup>[933]</sup></a> found in certain
  tombs, apparently prior to the dynasty of the Incas, two kinds of maize
  not now known in the country. With our flowers and culinary vegetables,
  <!-- Page 426 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page426"></a>{426}</span>the production of new varieties and their
  extinction has incessantly recurred. At the present time improved breeds
  sometimes displace at an extraordinarily rapid rate older breeds; as has
  recently occurred throughout England with pigs. The Long-horn cattle in
  their native home were "suddenly swept away as if by some murderous
  pestilence," by the introduction of Short-horns.<a name="NtA_934"
  href="#Nt_934"><sup>[934]</sup></a></p>

  <p>What grand results have followed from the long-continued action of
  methodical and unconscious selection, checked and regulated to a certain
  extent by natural selection, is seen on every side of us. Compare the
  many animals and plants which are displayed at our exhibitions with their
  parent-forms when these are known, or consult old historical records with
  respect to their former state. Almost all our domesticated animals have
  given rise to numerous and distinct races, excepting those which cannot
  be easily subjected to selection&mdash;such as cats, the cochineal
  insect, and the hive-bee,&mdash;and excepting those animals which are not
  much valued. In accordance with what we know of the process of selection,
  the formation of our many races has been slow and gradual. The man who
  first observed and preserved a pigeon with its &oelig;sophagus a little
  enlarged, its beak a little longer, or its tail a little more expanded
  than usual, never dreamed that he had made the first step in the creation
  of the pouter, carrier, and fantail-pigeon. Man can create not only
  anomalous breeds, but others with their whole structure admirably
  co-ordinated for certain purposes, such as the race-horse and dray-horse,
  or the greyhound. It is by no means necessary that each small change of
  structure throughout the body, leading towards excellence, should
  simultaneously arise and be selected. Although man seldom attends to
  differences in organs which are important under a physiological point of
  view, yet he has so profoundly modified some breeds, that assuredly, if
  found wild, they would be ranked under distinct genera.</p>

  <p>The best proof of what selection has effected is perhaps afforded by
  the fact that whatever part or quality in any animal, and more especially
  in any plant, is most valued by man, that part or quality differs most in
  the several races. This result is well seen by comparing the amount of
  difference <!-- Page 427 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page427"></a>{427}</span>between the fruits produced by the
  varieties of the same fruit-tree, between the flowers of the varieties in
  our flower-garden, between the seeds, roots, or leaves of our culinary
  and agricultural plants, in comparison with the other and not valued
  parts of the same plants. Striking evidence of a different kind is
  afforded by the fact ascertained by Oswald Heer,<a name="NtA_935"
  href="#Nt_935"><sup>[935]</sup></a> namely, that the seeds of a large
  number of plants,&mdash;wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, lentils,
  poppies,&mdash;cultivated for their seed by the ancient Lake-inhabitants
  of Switzerland, were all smaller than the seeds of our existing
  varieties. Rütimeyer has shown that the sheep and cattle which were kept
  by the earlier Lake-inhabitants were likewise smaller than our present
  breeds. In the middens of Denmark, the earliest dog of which the remains
  have been found was the weakest; this was succeeded during the Bronze age
  by a stronger kind, and this again during the Iron age by one still
  stronger. The sheep of Denmark during the Bronze period had
  extraordinarily slender limbs, and the horse was smaller than our present
  animal.<a name="NtA_936" href="#Nt_936"><sup>[936]</sup></a> No doubt in
  these cases the new and larger breeds were generally introduced from
  foreign lands by the immigration of new hordes of men. But it is not
  probable that each larger breed, which in the course of time supplanted a
  previous and smaller breed, was the descendant of a distinct and larger
  species; it is far more probable that the domestic races of our various
  animals were gradually improved in different parts of the great
  Europæo-Asiatic continent, and thence spread to other countries. This
  fact of the gradual increase in size of our domestic animals is all the
  more striking as certain wild or half-wild animals, such as red-deer,
  aurochs, park-cattle, and boars,<a name="NtA_937"
  href="#Nt_937"><sup>[937]</sup></a> have within nearly the same period
  decreased in size.</p>

  <p>The conditions favourable to selection by man are,&mdash;the closest
  attention being paid to every character,&mdash;long-continued
  perseverance,&mdash;facility in matching or separating animals,&mdash;and
  especially a large number being kept, so that the inferior individuals
  may be freely rejected or destroyed, and the better ones preserved. When
  many are kept there will also be a <!-- Page 428 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page428"></a>{428}</span>greater chance of the
  occurrence of well-marked deviations of structure. Length of time is
  all-important; for as each character, in order to become strongly
  pronounced, has to be augmented by the selection of successive variations
  of the same nature, this can only be effected during a long series of
  generations. Length of time will, also, allow any new feature to become
  fixed by the continued rejection of those individuals which revert or
  vary, and the preservation of those which inherit the new character.
  Hence, although some few animals have varied rapidly in certain respects
  under new conditions of life, as dogs in India and sheep in the West
  Indies, yet all the animals and plants which have produced strongly
  marked races were domesticated at an extremely remote epoch, often before
  the dawn of history. As a consequence of this, no record has been
  preserved of the origin of our chief domestic breeds. Even at the present
  day new strains or sub-breeds are formed so slowly that their first
  appearance passes unnoticed. A man attends to some particular character,
  or merely matches his animals with unusual care, and after a time a
  slight difference is perceived by his neighbours;&mdash;the difference
  goes on being augmented by unconscious and methodical selection, until at
  last a new sub-breed is formed, receives a local name, and spreads; but,
  by this time, its history is almost forgotten. When the new breed has
  spread widely, it gives rise to new strains and sub-breeds, and the best
  of these succeed and spread, supplanting other and older breeds; and so
  always onwards in the march of improvement.</p>

  <p>When a well-marked breed has once been established, if not supplanted
  by still improving sub-breeds, and if not exposed to greatly changed
  conditions of life, inducing further variability or reversion to
  long-lost characters, it may apparently last for an enormous period. We
  may infer that this is the case from the high antiquity of certain races;
  but some caution is necessary on this head, for the same variation may
  appear independently after long intervals of time, or in distant places.
  We may safely assume that this has occurred with the turnspit-dog which
  is figured on the ancient Egyptian monuments, with the solid-hoofed
  swine<a name="NtA_938" href="#Nt_938"><sup>[938]</sup></a> mentioned by
  Aristotle, with five-toed fowls <!-- Page 429 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page429"></a>{429}</span>described by Columella, and certainly with
  the nectarine. The dogs represented on the Egyptian monuments, about 2000
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, show us that some of the chief breeds
  then existed, but it is extremely doubtful whether any are identically
  the same with our present breeds. A great mastiff sculptured on an
  Assyrian tomb, 640 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, is said to be the same
  with the dog still imported into the same region from Thibet. The true
  greyhound existed during the Roman classical period. Coming down to a
  later period, we have seen that, though most of the chief breeds of the
  pigeon existed between two and three centuries ago, they have not all
  retained to the present day exactly the same character; but this has
  occurred in certain cases in which improvement was not desired, for
  instance in the case of the Spot or the Indian ground-tumbler.</p>

  <p>De Candolle<a name="NtA_939" href="#Nt_939"><sup>[939]</sup></a> has
  fully discussed the antiquity of various races of plants; he states that
  the black-seeded poppy was known in the time of Homer, the white-seeded
  sesamum by the ancient Egyptians, and almonds with sweet and bitter
  kernels by the Hebrews; but it does not seem improbable that some of
  these varieties may have been lost and reappeared. One variety of barley
  and apparently one of wheat, both of which were cultivated at an
  immensely remote period by the Lake-inhabitants of Switzerland, still
  exist. It is said<a name="NtA_940" href="#Nt_940"><sup>[940]</sup></a>
  that "specimens of a small variety of gourd which is still common in the
  market of Lima were exhumed from an ancient cemetery in Peru." De
  Candolle remarks that, in the books and drawings of the sixteenth
  century, the principal races of the cabbage, turnip, and gourd can be
  recognised; this might have been expected at so late a period, but
  whether any of these plants are absolutely identical with our present
  sub-varieties is not certain. It is, however, said that the Brussels
  sprout, a variety which in some places is liable to degeneration, has
  remained genuine for more than four centuries in the district where it is
  believed to have originated.<a name="NtA_941"
  href="#Nt_941"><sup>[941]</sup></a></p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In accordance with the views maintained by me in this work and
  elsewhere, not only the various domestic races, but the <!-- Page 430
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page430"></a>{430}</span>most distinct
  genera and orders within the same great class,&mdash;for instance,
  whales, mice, birds, and fishes&mdash;are all the descendants of one
  common progenitor, and we must admit that the whole vast amount of
  difference between these forms of life has primarily arisen from simple
  variability. To consider the subject under this point of view is enough
  to strike one dumb with amazement. But our amazement ought to be lessened
  when we reflect that beings, almost infinite in number, during an almost
  infinite lapse of time, have often had their whole organisation rendered
  in some degree plastic, and that each slight modification of structure
  which was in any way beneficial under excessively complex conditions of
  life, will have been preserved, whilst each which was in any way
  injurious will have been rigorously destroyed. And the long-continued
  accumulation of beneficial variations will infallibly lead to structures
  as diversified, as beautifully adapted for various purposes, and as
  excellently co-ordinated, as we see in the animals and plants all around
  us. Hence I have spoken of selection as the paramount power, whether
  applied by man to the formation of domestic breeds, or by nature to the
  production of species. I may recur to the metaphor given in a former
  chapter: if an architect were to rear a noble and commodious edifice,
  without the use of cut stone, by selecting from the fragments at the base
  of a precipice wedge-formed stones for his arches, elongated stones for
  his lintels, and flat stones for his roof, we should admire his skill and
  regard him as the paramount power. Now, the fragments of stone, though
  indispensable to the architect, bear to the edifice built by him the same
  relation which the fluctuating variations of each organic being bear to
  the varied and admirable structures ultimately acquired by its modified
  descendants.</p>

  <p>Some authors have declared that natural selection explains nothing,
  unless the precise cause of each slight individual difference be made
  clear. Now, if it were explained to a savage utterly ignorant of the art
  of building, how the edifice had been raised stone upon stone, and why
  wedge-formed fragments were used for the arches, flat stones for the
  roof, &amp;c.; and if the use of each part and of the whole building were
  pointed out, it would be unreasonable if he declared that nothing had
  been <!-- Page 431 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page431"></a>{431}</span>made clear to him, because the precise
  cause of the shape of each fragment could not be given. But this is a
  nearly parallel case with the objection that selection explains nothing,
  because we know not the cause of each individual difference in the
  structure of each being.</p>

  <p>The shape of the fragments of stone at the base of our precipice may
  be called accidental, but this is not strictly correct; for the shape of
  each depends on a long sequence of events, all obeying natural laws; on
  the nature of the rock, on the lines of deposition or cleavage, on the
  form of the mountain which depends on its upheaval and subsequent
  denudation, and lastly on the storm or earthquake which threw down the
  fragments. But in regard to the use to which the fragments may be put,
  their shape may be strictly said to be accidental. And here we are led to
  face a great difficulty, in alluding to which I am aware that I am
  travelling beyond my proper province. An omniscient Creator must have
  foreseen every consequence which results from the laws imposed by Him.
  But can it be reasonably maintained that the Creator intentionally
  ordered, if we use the words in any ordinary sense, that certain
  fragments of rock should assume certain shapes so that the builder might
  erect his edifice? If the various laws which have determined the shape of
  each fragment were not predetermined for the builder's sake, can it with
  any greater probability be maintained that He specially ordained for the
  sake of the breeder each of the innumerable variations in our domestic
  animals and plants;&mdash;many of these variations being of no service to
  man, and not beneficial, far more often injurious, to the creatures
  themselves? Did He ordain that the crop and tail-feathers of the pigeon
  should vary in order that the fancier might make his grotesque pouter and
  fantail breeds? Did He cause the frame and mental qualities of the dog to
  vary in order that a breed might be formed of indomitable ferocity, with
  jaws fitted to pin down the bull for man's brutal sport? But if we give
  up the principle in one case,&mdash;if we do not admit that the
  variations of the primeval dog were intentionally guided in order that
  the greyhound, for instance, that perfect image of symmetry and vigour,
  might be formed,&mdash;no shadow of reason can be assigned for the belief
  that variations, alike in nature and the result <!-- Page 432 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page432"></a>{432}</span>of the same general
  laws, which have been the groundwork through natural selection of the
  formation of the most perfectly adapted animals in the world, man
  included, were intentionally and specially guided. However much we may
  wish it, we can hardly follow Professor Asa Gray in his belief "that
  variation has been led along certain beneficial lines," like a stream
  "along definite and useful lines of irrigation." If we assume that each
  particular variation was from the beginning of all time preordained, the
  plasticity of organisation, which leads to many injurious deviations of
  structure, as well as that redundant power of reproduction which
  inevitably leads to a struggle for existence, and, as a consequence, to
  the natural selection or survival of the fittest, must appear to us
  superfluous laws of nature. On the other hand, an omnipotent and
  omniscient Creator ordains everything and foresees everything. Thus we
  are brought face to face with a difficulty as insoluble as is that of
  free will and predestination.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_26" href="#NtA_26">[26]</a> Vrolik has discussed this

  has kindly translated for me passages. <i>See</i>, also, Isidore Geoffroy
  St. Hilaire's 'Hist. des Anomalies,' 1832, tom. i. p. 684.</p>

  July, 1863.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_28" href="#NtA_28">[28]</a> Some great anatomists, as
  Cuvier and Meckel, believe that the tubercle one side of the hinder foot
  of the tailless Batrachians represents a sixth digit. Certainly, when the
  hinder foot of a toad, as soon as it first sprouts from the tadpole, is
  dissected, the partially ossified cartilage of this tubercle resembles
  under the microscope, in a remarkable manner, a digit. But the highest
  authority on such subjects, Gegenbaur (Untersuchung. zur vergleich. anat.
  der Wirbelthiere: Carpus et Tarsus, 1864, s. 63), concludes that this
  resemblance is not real, only superficial.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_29" href="#NtA_29">[29]</a> For these several statements,
  <i>see</i> Dr. Struthers, in work cited, especially on intermissions in
  the line of descent. Prof. Huxley, 'Lectures on our Knowledge of Organic
  Nature,' 1863, p. 97. With respect to inheritance, <i>see</i> Dr. Prosper
  Lucas, 'L'Hérédité Nat.,' tom. i. p. 325. Isid. Geoffroy, 'Anom.,' tom.

  1863, p. 462. On the inheritance of other anomalies in the extremities,
  <i>see</i> Dr. H. Dobell, in vol. xlvi. of 'Medico-Chirurg.
  Transactions,' 1863; also Mr. Sedgwick, in op. cit., April, 1863, p. 460.
  With respect to additional digits in the negro, <i>see</i> Prichard,
  'Physical History of Mankind.' Dr. Dieffenbach ('Journ. Royal Geograph.
  Soc.,' 1841, p. 208) says this anomaly is not uncommon with the
  Polynesians of the Chatham Islands.</p>

  was lost each time by disease.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_37" href="#NtA_37">[37]</a> So with insects, the larvæ
  reproduce lost limbs, but, except in one order, the mature insect has no
  such power. But the Myriapoda, which apparently represent the larvæ of
  true insects, have, as Newport has shown, this power until their last
  moult. <i>See</i> an excellent discussion on this whole subject by Dr.

  find that Dureau de la Malle ('Comptes Rendus,' tom. xli., 1855, p. 690)
  advances this as a good instance of reversion to the primitive stock, and
  as confirmatory of a still more vague statement in classical times by

  raised from a Spanish cock and Silver-pencilled Hamburgh hen, neither of
  which are incubators, and no less than seven out of eight hens in these
  two broods "showed a perfect obstinacy in sitting." The Rev. E.&nbsp;S. Dixon
  ('Ornamental Poultry,' 1848, p. 200) says that chickens reared from a
  cross between Golden and Black Polish fowls, are "good and steady birds
  to sit." Mr. B.&nbsp;P. Brent informs me that he raised some good sitting hens
  by crossing Pencilled Hamburgh and Polish breeds. A cross-bred bird from
  a Spanish non-incubating cock and Cochin incubating hen is mentioned in
  the 'Poultry Chronicle,' vol. iii. p. 13, as an "exemplary mother." On
  the other hand, an exceptional case is given in the 'Cottage Gardener,'
  1860, p. 388, of a hen raised from a Spanish cock and black Polish hen
  which did not incubate.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_151" href="#NtA_151">[151]</a> Flourens, 'Longévité
  Humaine,' p. 144, on crossed jackals. With respect to the difference
  between the mule and the hinny, I am aware that this has generally been
  attributed to the sire and dam transmitting their characters differently;
  but Colin, who has given in his 'Traité Phys. Comp.,' tom. ii. pp.
  537-539, the fullest description which I have met with of these
  reciprocal hybrids, is strongly of opinion that the ass preponderates in
  both crosses, but in an unequal degree. This is likewise the conclusion
  of Flourens, and of Bechstein in his 'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands,' b.
  i. s. 294. The tail of the hinny is much more like that of the horse than
  is the tail of the mule, and this is generally accounted for by the males
  of both species transmitting with greater power this part of their
  structure; but a compound hybrid which I saw in the Zoological Gardens,
  from a mare by a hybrid ass-zebra, closely resembled its mother in its
  tail.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_152" href="#NtA_152">[152]</a> Mr. Hewitt, who has had
  such great experience in raising these hybrids, says ('Poultry Book,' by
  Mr. Tegetmeier, 1866, pp. 165-167) that in all, the head was destitute of
  wattles, comb, and ear-lappets; and all closely resembled the pheasant in
  the shape of the tail and general contour of the body. These hybrids were
  raised from hens of several breeds by a cock-pheasant; but another
  hybrid, described by Mr. Hewitt, was raised from a hen-pheasant by a
  silver-laced Bantam cock, and this possessed a rudimental comb and
  wattles.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_229" href="#NtA_229">[229]</a> The following facts, given
  by Kölreuter in his 'Dritte Fortsetzung,' s. 34, 39, appear at first
  sight strongly to confirm Mr. Scott's and Gärtner's statements; and to a
  certain limited extent they do so. Kölreuter asserts, from innumerable
  observations, that insects incessantly carry pollen from one species and
  variety of Verbascum to another; and I can confirm this assertion; yet he
  found that the white and yellow varieties of <i>Verbascum lychnitis</i>
  often grew wild mingled together: moreover, he cultivated these two
  varieties in considerable numbers during four years in his garden, and
  they kept true by seed; but when he crossed them, they produced flowers
  of an intermediate tint. Hence it might have thought that both varieties
  must have a stronger elective affinity for the pollen of their own
  variety than for that of the other; this elective affinity, I may add, of
  each species for its own pollen (Kölreuter, 'Dritte Forts.,' s. 39, and
  Gärtner, 'Bastarderz.,' <i>passim</i>) being a perfectly well-ascertained
  power. But the force of the foregoing facts is much lessened by Gärtner's
  numerous experiments, for, differently from Kölreuter, he never once got
  ('Bastarderz.,' s. 307) an intermediate tint when he crossed the yellow
  and white flowered varieties of Verbascum. So that the fact of the white
  and yellow varieties keeping true to their colour by seed does not prove
  that they were not mutually fertilised by the pollen carried by insects
  from one to the other.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_230" href="#NtA_230">[230]</a> 'Amaryllidaceæ,' 1837, p.

  sub-var. of the last; (5) major latifol. fl. alb.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_237" href="#NtA_237">[237]</a> Kölreuter was so much
  struck with this fact that he suspected that a little pollen of <i>N.
  glutinosa</i> in one of his experiments might have accidentally got
  mingled with that of <i>var. perennis</i>, and thus aided its fertilising
  power. But we now know conclusively from Gärtner ('Bastarderz.,' s. 34,
  431) that two kinds of pollen never act <i>conjointly</i> on a third
  species; still less will the pollen of a distinct species, mingled with a
  plant's own pollen, if the latter be present in sufficient quantity, have
  any effect. The sole effect of mingling two kinds of pollen is to produce
  in the same capsule seeds which yield plants, some taking after the one
  and some after the other parent.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_238" href="#NtA_238">[238]</a> Mr. Scott has made some
  observations on the absolute sterility of a purple and white primrose
  (<i>Primula vulgaris</i>) when fertilised by pollen from the primrose
  ('Journal of Proc. of Linn. Soc.,' vol. viii., 1864, p. 98); but these
  observations require confirmation. I raised a number of purple-flowered
  long-styled seedlings from seed kindly sent me by Mr. Scott, and, though
  they were all some degree sterile, they were much more fertile with
  pollen taken from the common primrose than with their own pollen. Mr.
  Scott has likewise described a red equal-styled cowslip (<i>P. veris</i>,
  idem, p. 106), which was found by him to be highly sterile when crossed
  with the common cowslip; but this was not the case with several
  equal-styled red seedlings raised by me from his plant. This variety of
  the cowslip presents the remarkable peculiarity of combining male organs
  in every respect like those of the short-styled form, with female organs
  resembling in function and partly in structure those of the long-styled
  form; so that we have the singular anomaly of the two forms combined in
  the same flower. Hence it is not surprising that these flowers should be
  spontaneously self-infertile in a high degree.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_387" href="#NtA_387">[387]</a> Numerous instances could be
  given. Thus Livingstone ('Travels,' p. 217) states that the King of the
  Barotse, an inland tribe which never had any communication with white
  men, was extremely fond of taming animals, and every young antelope was
  brought to him. Mr. Galton informs me that the Damaras are likewise fond
  of keeping pets. The Indians of South America follow the same habit.
  Capt. Wilkes states that the Polynesians of the Samoan Islands tamed
  pigeons; and the New Zealanders, as Mr. Mantell informs me, kept various
  kinds of birds.</p>

  constitution, Dr. William Ogle has given me the following extract from
  Professor Trousseau's Lectures ('Clinique Médicale,' tom. i. p. 523), in
  which a curious case is recorded:&mdash;"J'ai donné mes soins à deux
  frères jumeaux, tous deux si extraordinairement ressemblants qu'il
  m'était impossible de les reconnaître, à moins de les voir l'un à côté de
  l'autre. Cette ressemblance physique s'étendait plus loin: ils avaient,
  permettez-moi l'expression, une similitude pathologique plus remarquable
  encore. Ainsi l'un d'eux que je voyais aux néothermes à Paris malade
  d'une ophthalmie rhumatismale me disait, 'En ce moment mon frère doit
  avoir une ophthalmie comme la mienne;' et comme je m'étais récrié, il me
  montrait quelques jours après une lettre qu'il venait de recevoir de ce
  frère alors à Vienne, et qui lui écrivait en effet&mdash;'J'ai mon
  ophthalmie, tu dois avoir la tienne.' Quelque singulier que ceci puisse
  paraître, le fait non est pas moins exact: on ne me l'a pas raconté, je
  l'ai vu, et j'en ai vu d'autres analogues dans ma pratique. Ces deux
  jumeaux étaient aussi tous deux asthmatiques, et asthmatiques à un
  effroyable degré. Originaires de Marseille, ils n'ont jamais pu demeurer
  dans cette ville, où leurs intérêts les appelaient souvent, sans être
  pris de leurs accès; jamais ils n'en éprouvaient à Paris. Bien mieux, il
  leur suffisait de gagner Toulon pour être guéris de leurs attaques de
  Marseilles. Voyageant sans cesse et dans tous pays pour leurs affaires,
  ils avaient remarqué que certaines localités leur étaient funestes, que
  dans d'autres ils étaient exempts de tout phénomène d'oppression."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_836" href="#NtA_836">[836]</a> Mr. Herbert Spencer
  ('Principles of Biology,' 1864, vol. i. pp. 452, 468) takes a different
  view; and in one place remarks: "We have seen reason to think that, as
  fast as essential faculties multiply, and as fast as the number of organs
  that co-operate in any given function increases, indirect equilibration
  through natural selection becomes less and less capable of producing
  specific adaptations; and remains fully capable only of maintaining the
  general fitness of constitution to conditions." This view that natural
  selection can do little in modifying the higher animals surprises me,
  seeing that man's selection has undoubtedly effected much with our
  domesticated quadrupeds and birds.</p>

  Montgomery ('On the Formation of so-called Cells in Animal Bodies,' 1867,
  p. 42), who denies that cells are derived from other cells by a process
  of growth, but believes that they originate through certain chemical
  changes.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_902" href="#NtA_902">[902]</a> Prof. Huxley has called my
  attention to the views of Buffon and Bonnet. The former ('Hist. Nat.
  Gén.,' edit. of 1749, tom. ii. pp. 54, 62, 329, 333, 420, 425) supposes
  that organic molecules exist in the food consumed by every living
  creature; and that these molecules are analogous in nature with the
  various organs by which they are absorbed. When the organs thus become
  fully developed, the molecules being no longer required collect and form
  buds or the sexual elements. If Buffon had assumed that his organic
  molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his
  view and mine would have been closely similar.</p>

  <p>Bonnet ('&OElig;uvres d'Hist. Nat.,' tom. v., part i., 1781, 4to
  edit., p. 334) speaks of the limbs having germs adapted for the
  reparation of all possible losses; but whether these germs are supposed
  to be the same with those within the buds and sexual organs is not clear.
  His famous but now exploded theory of <i>emboîtement</i> implies that
  perfect germs are included within germs in endless succession, pre-formed
  and ready for all succeeding generations. According to my view, the germs
  or gemmules of each separate part were not originally pre-formed, but are
  continually produced at all ages during each generation, with some handed
  down from preceding generations.</p>

  <p>Prof. Owen remarks ('Parthenogenesis,' 1849, pp. 5-8), "Not all the
  progeny of the primary impregnated germ-cell are required for the
  formation of the body in all animals: certain of the derivative
  germ-cells may remain unchanged and become included in that body which
  has been composed of their metamorphosed and diversely combined or
  confluent brethren: so included, any derivative germ-cell, or the nucleus
  of such, may commence and repeat the same processes of growth by
  imbibition, and of propagation by spontaneous fission, as those to which
  itself owed its origin;" &amp;c. By the agency of these germ-cells Prof.
  Owen accounts for parthenogenesis, for propagation by self-division
  during successive generations, and for the repairs of injuries. His view
  agrees with mine in the assumed transmission and multiplication of his
  germ-cells, but differs fundamentally from mine in the belief that the
  primary germ-cell was formed within the ovarium of the female and was
  fertilised by the male. My gemmules are supposed to be formed, quite
  independently of sexual concourse, by each separate cell or unit
  throughout the body, and to be merely aggregated within the reproductive
  organs.</p>

  <p>Lastly, Mr. Herbert Spencer ('Principles of Biology,' vol. i., 1863-4,
  chaps. iv. and viii.) has discussed at considerable length what he
  designates as physiological units. These agree with my gemmules in being
  supposed to multiply and to be transmitted from parent to child; the
  sexual elements are supposed to serve merely as their vehicles; they are
  the efficient agents in all the forms of reproduction and in the repairs
  of injuries; they account for inheritance, but they are not brought to
  bear on reversion or atavism, and this is unintelligible to me; they are
  supposed to possess polarity, or, as I call it, affinity; and apparently
  they are believed to be derived from each separate part of the whole
  body. But gemmules differ from Mr. Spencer's physiological units,
  inasmuch as a certain number, or mass of them, are, as we shall see,
  requisite for the development of each cell or part. Nevertheless I should
  have concluded that Mr. Spencer's views were fundamentally the same with
  mine, had it not been for several passages which, as far as I understand
  them, indicate something quite different. I will quote some of these
  passages from pp. 254-256. "In the fertilised germ we have two groups of
  physiological units, slightly different in their structures."... "It is
  not obvious that change in the form of the part, caused by changed
  action, involves such change in the physiological units throughout the
  organism, that these, when groups of them are thrown off in the shape of
  reproductive centres, will unfold into organisms that have this part
  similarly changed in form. Indeed, when treating of Adaptation, we saw
  that an organ modified by increase or decrease of function can but slowly
  so react on the system at large as to bring about those correlative
  changes required to produce a new equilibrium; and yet only when such new
  equilibrium has been established, can we expect it to be <i>fully</i>
  expressed in the modified physiological units of which the organism is
  built&mdash;only then can we count on a complete transfer of the
  modification to descendants."... "That the change in the offspring must,
  other things equal, be in the same direction as the change in the parent,
  we may dimly see is implied by the fact, that the change propagated
  throughout the parental system is a change towards a new state of
  equilibrium&mdash;a change tending to bring the actions of all organs,
  reproductive included, into harmony with these new actions."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_903" href="#NtA_903">[903]</a> M. Philipeaux ('Comptes
  Rendus,' Oct. 1, 1866, p. 576, and June, 1867) has lately shown that when
  the entire fore-limb, including the scapula, is extirpated, the power of
  regrowth is lost. From this he concludes that it is necessary for
  regrowth that a small portion of the limb should be left. But as in the
  lower animals the whole body may be bisected and both halves be
  reproduced, this belief does not seem probable. May not the early closing
  of a deep wound, as in the case of the extirpation of the scapula,
  prevent the formation or protrusion of the nascent limb?</p>

  Edinburgh, calculated, in the same manner as I have done for some British
  orchids ('Fertilisation of Orchids,' p. 344), the number of seeds in a
  capsule of an Acropera, and found the number to be 371,250. Now this
  plant produces several flowers on a raceme and many racemes during a
  season. In an allied genus, Gongora, Mr. Scott has seen twenty capsules
  produced on a single raceme: ten such racemes on the Acropera would yield
  above seventy-four millions of seed. I may add that Fritz Müller informs
  me that he found in a capsule of a Maxillaria, in South Brazil, that the
  seed weighed 42½ grains: he then arranged half a grain of seed in a
  narrow line, and by counting a measured length found the number in the
  half-grain to be 20,667, so that in the capsule there must have been
  1,756,440 seeds! The same plant sometimes produces half-a-dozen
  capsules.</p>

  Ernst Häckel has recently ('Monatsbericht Akad. Wiss. Berlin,' Feb. 2nd,
  1865) observed the surprising case of a medusa, with its reproductive
  organs active, which produces by budding a widely different form of
  medusa; and this latter also has the power of sexual reproduction. Krohn
  has shown ('Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.,' 3rd series, vol. xix., 1862,

  this effect by Sir H. Holland in his 'Medical Notes,' 1839, p. 32.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_926" href="#NtA_926">[926]</a> This is the view taken by
  Prof. Häckel, in his 'Generelle Morphologie' (B. ii. s. 171), who says:
  "Lediglich die partielle Identität der specifischconstituirten Materie im
  elterlichen und im kindlichen Organismus, die Theilung dieser Materie bei
  der Fortpflanzung, ist die Ursache der Erblichkeit."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_927" href="#NtA_927">[927]</a> In these remarks I, in
  fact, follow Naudin, who speaks of the elements or essences of the two
  species which are crossed. See his excellent memoir in the 'Nouvelles
  Archives du Muséum,' tom. i. p. 151.</p>
